0,Abhishek,iPhone 11 review,2,"iPhone11 Review A person who uses every major application of a phone such as a camera, notes, gaming, binge-watching, and also wants his phone to run smoothly for at least 3-5 years may go for iPhone11. According to my experience, I would suggest the iPhone11 as the best choice because I’ve been using Android for the last 5 years and the issue which I was facing with my phone was, it started to hang within 2-3 years of its purchase. It also began to overheat if I would continuously use its activities such as watching videos or playing games. Besides, the major issue with an android phone is privacy. It requires that data on mobile devices has to be transmitted to Google servers, which is used for targeted advertising. This makes Android a less private mobile operating system. I remember that whenever I used to search for a product on the Amazon app, my phone was flooded with ads of the searched product. So, to get rid of all of the above issues I  thought to give a try to the iOS operating system instead of buying another Android phone. Apple is committed to its customer privacy, and their phones also come with a powerful CPU(Central Processing Unit) which makes them compatible to do with multitasking for a long duration without facing any problem. Among all the iPhone models, I found iPhone11 budget-friendly. Being the latest model it covered various shortcomings of old models. It has better performance, great durability, a dual-camera system, and many other features.  One of the most important reasons why I chose the iPhone11 over former iPhones is that it comes with an A13 Bionic chip and is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone which falls under the price range of this phone. With this powerful beast, I can perform various multitasking without experiencing any lag. It also has the best GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) which allows you to watch videos at their highest graphics. I remember when I used to play games on my old phone it suddenly stop but now my experience with the new iPhone11 in terms of gaming is amazing, the whole game runs smoothly without any frame drop. However, I would not recommend gaming on iPhone11 for a long time because it starts to overheat. Additionally, its iOS 14 update is the best update I have ever seen on any smartphone. One of my favorite features in this update is ‘picture in Picture’ in which I can continue to watch a video or make a FaceTime while we are using another app. Such type of amazing applications help me to provide the best possible performance especially when I use my phone for multitasking.  Apple claims that they had used the toughest glass on the back and in front in iPhone11 and its aluminum case provides extra durability to it. Apart from this it also comes IP68 rating which means it is fit enough to withstand dust, dirt, and is resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater. I had also seen many youtube videos in which people do the toughest test on iPhone11 such as they make it sink in the water for an elongated time and when they take it out it works completely the same as it was before. Such waterproofing makes it possible to take underwater pictures and videos which are pretty amazing.  Iphones are already quite famous for their camera quality but it becomes even better with iPhone11. iPhone11 comes with an amazing dual-camera system which means that now users have a choice to shoot photos or videos in wide and ultra-wide mode. It also comes with stereoscopic depth which allows taking portraits of all the objects. It is one of the major changes that the iPhone has undertaken because, in earlier iPhones, users were able to take a portrait of the human face only. It also comes with night vision mode which helps to capture the photos in dim light places which is a very useful feature for me because as compared to my earlier phone there was no such option to do the same. It can be used for a variety of different hobbies such as if you are a vlogger you can use it to shoot videos in 4k and if you are an amateur photographer you can use it to capture the finest photo which can ever be taken on a smartphone.  Along with that one of the crucial features that I like about the iPhone is its astonishing “continuity feature” that makes it seamless to connect all the Apple devices altogether. for example, through this feature, we can make cellular calls with any of the Apple devices which are connected to your iPhone.As I am also looking forward to buy a Macbook, this feature will help me a lot in completing my college assignments as with the help of this feature I can use my iPhone to scan documents or take a picture and have it appear instantly on my Mac, and Apple continues to add such type of incredible and unique features that can make your work easier.  Being a college student I accept that Rs.72,0000 price tag seemed to be a little steepy but,  my experience with this phone has proven it to be worth the cost. After years of purchasing random phones that promised me to provide the best experience in terms of durability, performance, camera quality it is the iPhone11 which finally delivered such claims. I personally recommend you to buy this complete package of the newest technology presently available."

2,PR,Beast with a limp,5,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone’s features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a “Liquid Retina display”; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won’t notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ₹, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the “budget” phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79₹ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase “it just works” really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn’t too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It’s safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the “soli” chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It’s Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won’t say too much on this topic as it’s well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it’s hardware."
3,stella,The best iPhone - perfect combination of features!,4,"This is my first iPhone. After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.-----------------------************------------------------Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.------------------------***********-----------------------Cons:1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.--------------------************----------------------Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.***************************************Love the black color.***************************************Fun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care."

9,Austin Shameju Cherakkal,So far so good...(1 week user),4,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don’t worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn’t you just need to use your passcode so it isn’t bad. For the most part it’s quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."

12,Abhishek,Still a great buy even after 2 years,2,"So far its going good, has been a great purchase while upgrading from Iphone 7 to Iphone 11..

15,Aamir,Detailed Review// Unexpected 😲,4,"First of all a very big thank you to Amazon great Indian sale as I bought this device for 46,249 and I really did not expect that I would get iPhone 11 at this price I’m truly very happy that I could wait all this long to buy a new phone. Eventually I never thought that I would be an Apple fan as I was a big time android user for 10 years.Well I was about to buy one +8 pro and I was quite confused whether should I go with one +8 pro or iPhone 11. I compared both the phones and eventually I decided to go with iPhone 11 as one +8 pro camera is really not up to the mark for what we actually pay in fact if I want to compare Samsung M series phones have better camera than one +8 pro. Other than camera one +8 pro is really a top notch phone in terms of display and sound quality.No let’s talk about iPhone 11 and I am giving this review after 20 days of my usage & I am really a heavy user.Camera as outstanding, top notch, till now and from past 10 years I have never seen a camera which is this amazing in terms of quality and shots infact night mode is extremely superb. The ultrawide camera is the best ultrawide camera which iPhone 11 gives and comparing iPhone 11 with one +8 pro it’s a shame even though one +8 pro gives a 48 megapixel camera it doesn’t give the best quality & filed of view.Talking about performance trust me this has one of the powerful chipset if compared to snapdragon 865, Like really no other phone can beat it.I don’t know what sampling rate iPhone 11 has but the display is amazingly smooth and silky; that touch response is a “WOW”The face recognition is amazing!! more than my expectations because it really doesn’t work like what android system is, The privacy and security which iPhone offers is the best.Now talking about battery life it is really good when it comes to a standby mode but when you actually keep using the phone continuously, it drains out and maximum time you can use is just 5 hours 35 minutes. And charging time with 5W charger takes more than 2 hours 30 minutes.Talking about build quality it is good, stylish, superb but kind of heavy as it has the best glass on both sides infact on the first day itself it fell down from a height of 4 feet and I was surprised that it didn’t break.Talking about gaming, trust me it heats a lot. I mean I have played PUBG at high graphics as well as Asphalt 9 and the back panel does heat up quickly and at some point you cannot even hold it.So I would say, Buying an iPhone for gaming won’t be a good choice as it heats up a lot and playing continuously will definitely drain out the battery....I was quite worried to buy an iPhone from Amazon because there were lot of negative reviews and few of them said that it’s a fraud and they have been cheated but luckily in my case; 🤞🏼I really got the original product, a genuine one and I didn’t face any issue in terms of packaging."
16,Abhishek,Got at a lowest price,4,Good phone to buy
17,Dr Gunjan Jain,Iphone,5,Happy with the purchase.Camera quality is good too . Got for my Sister.Thank you Amazon .

19,Harish,iPhone XR with better Camera and Internals,5,"This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need."

21,Vickey talukdar,Coming from Androids planning to stay.,4,"Been a few weeks since I got the phone, coming from a Galaxy S10, only reason I had to switch was giving my phone away to someone else in the family, and every other Androids gotten awfully boring decided to give iPhones a shot after a long time and I don't think I will be switching back any time soon. If you come from a similar android flagship there are a few things you need to get used to, in terms of the software its snappy not as fast as some androids but it feels smooth and has a flow to it.Display is where you might get disappointed with but don't worry its not as bad as they say, its bright its got ample clarity and if you pixel peep you will see a few pixels here and there but nothing that will disappoint you but its brighter for some reason iOS has a very clean color palette which gives it a nice vibrant interface, watching video is alright but you will sure miss the deep blacks if you come from OLED but the dolby vision certification sure makes up for it.Battery is downright impressive I can go through a whole day without putting it on charge and still finish with more than 40 percent juice left and I often get close to 9 hours average in screen on time as well I even left the phone unattended for 8 hours and it only drained one percent and still went through the whole day without a hiccup.Camera is one of the best at what it does though Pixels and Galaxies might take slightly better pictures but if you use Instagram or Snapchat a lot this phone will do wonders for you miles ahead of any other android in terms of social media performance.There is a certain heft to the phone the S10 feels like paper and walking or holding this phone feels like a chore if you also have one of those fat spigen cases on but you will get used to it. I will suggest you put a case on this bad boy as it does tend to get scuffed around the edges my friends iPhone had the same problem.I dont have an Apple Ecosystem per se, but i got Airplay on my TV so I can stream my Apple Music library to it and play it over the sound system you can also do spotify.For someone who is coming from Android since a long time this phone is the cake, absolutely delight to use small things do make a difference and also no auxiliary or usb c so carry around a spare lighting cable around with you and also charging by default is at 5 watts you could use a fast charger to get it upto 18, though I havent found the charging slow maybe because I dont use it while it does charge.The notch is there but most of the action happens below it so its fine and you will start to ignore it after an hour.PS: lot of negative reviews for the seller but what I got was a phone fresh from the factory in her wraps and only had one wifi calling glitch which was my fault apart from that the phones been absolutely stellar and Amazons been great delivering it in the pandemic too"

24,Abhishek,Best in class.,2,"If you need an iOS device at low price, go for it. For camera freaks not recommended if you are into telephoto clicks because it doesn't have a telephoto lens. But best in its class. I do remember it had the best camera after after pixel 2 xl and huawei p30 pro. Good battery life. Gets you through the day with moderate use but do buy a 20 w charger. Ahead of times processor, no question about that. Screen goes upto 1080p 60hz, not recommended if you use a 120/90hz device already, you will get stuck at slow motion. nice speakers if you still listen to music on speaker...it has that iconic punch of a little base that every iPhone has. But I do recommend to go for the higher variants if not necessarily an emergency to have an iOS device. If you are okay with an android device I do recommend comparing it with others like OnePlus, samsung, nothing etc, once."
25,Manish Singh,Best but Amazon ruined it ;(,5,"Well well well! The most hyped iPhone of the year isn’t quite there at least not for me.It has a best camera undoubtedly, but the other side of the coin is not that good. So I was an android user, 1 Plus more specifically. I was excited to switch to the iPhone as most of you maybe. Amazon was pretty good at the delivery and I got it within 3 days. During my first day usage I noticed a slight warm feeling on the right side of my phone from top to bottom on the back. It was prominent and I could feel the heat that was generated. I looked online and fixed some setting like location and notifications which would put a lot of pressure on your battery. So i thought it is fixed but it wasn’t.To be honest I never thought of iPhones getting warm within a few minutes of youtube playback or social networking on WhatsApp or Instagram. It was all that I had never thought of. My onePlus 6 was a beast in this matter and half the price of iPhone 11, nonetheless I used it for a few days and kept looking for solutions but all would say it is quite normal for an iPhone to get warm.To be on the safer side I thought of replacement but Amazon won’t allow you unless you have a job sheet from an authorised apple service centre, which was quite new for me. As earlier no matter the cost of the product a replacement window was always open. A disappointment then!So with a heavy heart I headed towards the iPhone Service Centre some 15 kms away from my place. While reaching there I put forward my issues and they were like sir it is quite normal for the iPhones unless you get a warning of over heating. They were not ready to make a job sheet instead suggested for a diagnostic test, which came out normal.It has been a week now, I can still feel that warmth on the right side of my phone and I suppose I have to get used to it.Talking about the other things the phone offers, Camera quality is the best, you get some awesome video and audio quality. A top notch I must say.You will have to cautiously use it for a longer battery life.The charging brick is good for a normal user, it is a bit slow in charging but it is not necessary to spend some ₹3000 plus fo a new charger and a cable.Face recognition is fast but I still miss my fingerprint in times of this Pandemic.So the bottom line is worst Amazon Experience, you better buy it from an authorised dealer or go to appleonlinestoreindia for some good deals.And yeah! winter is coming so I have got it covered thanks to iPhone 11:) Cheers!!!"
26,Gaayathridevi R,Love it,3,I'm excited about this product even before it's launch... Overall it's camera storage and battery life is Decent.... My appeal to iphone company... Kindly also dispatch the adapter also
27,VIVEK ,Amazing,5,"Best in class. I rated it 4 only because it has slightly thicker bezels but that's okay, knew it before buying. This one is a gaming beast. PUBG runs buttery smooth and clicks amazing photos."
28,John Delas,Excellent !,5,
29,Anugra,A detailed review,3,"After 3 months of usage, It feels smooth and it’s the first time I’ve used an IOS device. Following are few points describing the product.1) Screen and display:The screen is quite comfortable to look at and the adaptive display works excellent. The transition from one app to another is so smooth and satisfying. The display adapts according to lighting and quite easy on the eyes. There’s blue light filter (true tone) which gives a warm hue to the display. Brightness when set to max is excellent even in day light.Update: The phone is dust proof and waterproof and underwater pictures are phenomenal. No need to worry if you dropped your phone in water.2) Software:Currently on IOS 14, the interface is to a next level. It took few days to adapt according to the interface but now, every app is smooth and easy to use.The face unlock is so accurate as it uses infrared light and smart unlock. That means no one can unlock your phone while you’re asleep so your phone is secure. Also you can unlock your phone even in dim to dark lit rooms or in absolutely no external light. The phone has lot’s of shortcuts making your use super easy and quick. No doubt about the security! Each and every bit of data is safe on your device.3) batteryAs I’m not a heavy gamer, the battery is enough for an entire day or 2 at max. Switching from android to iOS i used battery of 6000mah which still is more than apple’s 3110mah but the ios battery management is really great. You can watch videos at max brightness for quite a long time on this plus if you’re a heavy gamer, you may have to charge the device maybe twice a day. Also the battery optimisation is an excellent feature which saves your device from overcharging.4) cameraWell it’s iphone baby! Camera is excellent and most clear pictures and videos are captured from the camera. A 10/10 for camera and videos. If you’re into making content for YouTube or instagram, this phone’s camera would be perfect. Also the pictures captured are quite vivid.Few cons of the device1) The notch takes up little more space of the screen. I personally don’t find it annoying but few people may.2) Phone may heat a little during charging.3) If you bought this after selling your kidney, you must stay hydrated. Be very careful with your phone as even a little scratch would hurt your heart a lot."

32,Amazon Customer,Engineered to perfection.,4,"10 months agoi've had android for 5 years i was looking for a change in pace when i switched over to boost. My first iphone was a 6s Plus with boost mobile, after having it for a week i became an iphone fan. i overall enjoyed the camera, processing power,and the polarizing display. What i did not like was the battery life, that aspect needed improvement. When the boost guy at store mentioned i could get a new phone through payments i looked into a new device because i did not enjoy the battery life lasting me 4 to 6 hours after being charged 100%. So after talking to apple experts and even samsung enthusiasts i came to the cross road of the s10e and iphone 11 (the regular) and decided to give a go on the iphone 11 after the store rep mentioned iphones pick up better compared to samsung in the area i live. SURE ENOUGH!!! spots with no signal..BOOM! SERVICE! now keep in mind im not saying you'll have service every where you go due to some areas having no service, but i can vouch that areas my iphone 6s plus struggled to load or pick up a siganl bar at drastically improved. ALONG WITH BATTERY LIFE!!! this phone lasts me 10 to 12 hours off a single charge. keep in mind no i do not use low power mode thats just how good the battery life is on the iphone 11. lastly, i know there's android devices on the market that boast a big screen, long lasting battery life, and good cameras which are cheaper compared to iphones but thats the problem i kept running into was finding a durable phone. after 5 years of using the android platform i went through 8 or 10 devices from zte, lg, and samsung. all because the storage was too full, or because an antennae or battery had burned out. from what i hear iphone 11 users should expect a life span of 3 years. thats pretty good considering i go through phones because of internal issues not physical damage like crazyyy!!! overall look the iphone 11 is engineered quality in the camera, storage, battery, processing and display department. the price is well worth THE QUALITY put into this phone"
33,Vinayak Bhardwaj,Iphone 11,5,Purchased for my freind and got good feedback from him.But I thought still price is on little higher side
34,Deep shaw,GREAT PHONE GREAT PRICE,5,So this is my first iphone. Was using android before and not surprised this phone is tooooo good. Got mine for 44k 128gb. According to me these are the pros and consPROS :1. Camera is super good even good than some of the flagship Android in 20212. Performance is undoubtedly the best no lag easy multi tasking heavy games like PUBG/ BGMI runs super smooth with constant 60 fps.3. Battery life : By looking at the spec sheet I was a bit worried coz it is way smaller than my android phone but to be surprised it is lasting way longer than I expected. I am a very heavy user so I need to charge my phone 2 times a day i.e from 90%-35% to maintain battery health4. Build quality : Super premium. Feels good in hand.5. Speakers : Loud enough for your mom to say ' avaj kam kr de kitna Shor krra h' 😂Cons:1. Display : Quality is not good for 2021 standards. It's not like that it's bad but not upto the mark compared to even some midrange android phones.2. Notch : Feels a bit weird in 2021. This is subjective but I'm just saying it if you are buying one in 2021 consider this3. No 5g : No 5g supported so if you are gonna keep this one for a long time consider this4. Accessories : Almost no accessories in box so you have to buy one separately and to be honest they are expensive.Altogether it's a great phone even in 2021.
35,Rishabh Soni,Good phone feature,5,
36,Abhishek,Amazing,2,This is my first time from android to iPhone and totally loved this product and was worth the money not only the camera but also the features are also amazing.
37,Shresta reddy,Battery Usage | Health,5,"I am reviewing this product after 10 months.So far so good. My battery health is now 96% and i never charge it for more than 80% using 20w charger. So the battery is working nicely.The performance is overall positive. No lag No heating. The picture quality is looking nice. I never use this device for storage. Hence 64 GB is enough for my usage.However if you use cellular networks, it will suck your battery and make it drained.Important- Whoever use mobile internet instead of wifi, this phone battery will drain as much as possible and make you to charge it for many times than usual. Furthermore the battery health gets gradually decreased as well."
38,DRx Rakesh,Best smartphone I have ever used…,5,"Writing my review after three days of usage… I recommend everyone to update the software to the latest version before using the phone as there may be heating issues when the mobile is used without updating the software…I got my delivery the very next day of ordering the iPhone…Thanks to Amazon’s one day delivery…The product came in a secured package and the packaging was awesome…The camera quality is excellent…There is no second choice when it comes to IPhone camera…Regarding battery life…I’m getting one day of battery life for a normal usage with few hours of YouTube usage and phone calls…Battery life is Good.Phone is super smooth without Any lag…If you have budget then go for IPhone 12 as that comes with A14 Bionic chip that will be faster than this A13 chip…No Touch ID(fingerprint reader)…FaceID works like charm…unlocks even in extremely dark environment…Only issue is you cannot unlock your phone when wearing face-mask😀Night mode is good but not up to the mark..You can find noise in the images with night mode turned on…Dual SIM card configuration…Primary physical SIM card and secondary sim is an e-sim… e-SIM can be easily activated by contacting the network provider..In my case my secondary sim is Airtel…Send this SMS to 121 if you are using Airtel…”eSIM<space>your email ID”…you will receive a confirmation SMS immediately and after you confirm, you will receive a confirmation call, after you give your consent, you will receive a QR code to the registered email., Now go to the settings in your iPhone, Click on mobile data and then click add data plan and scan the QR., that’s it., Your eSIM will be activated within 2 hours.,Note: If you have not updated your email with the network provider call 121 for Airtel and register your email., it will take up to 2 days to update.,Will update the review after one month of usage…So far so good!"

43,Piyush sonavane,Disappointed,4,Got scratches in camera lens🙁💔
44,abhishek kumar,Best Value For Money Device.,5,"This Is My First Apple Device In my Life So I am Sharing Experience.First Of all this device has premium quality design . And best user experience , camera quality is great if you want best photos like DSLR Then just go for it . The security is always top notch in apple devices so chill and use it freely . The battery backup is also good. The best but not the least thing I like about this smartphone is audio the speaker sound of this device is awesome clear and loud and crisp .The display of this device Is HD Plus but trust me the panel of this display is very high quality so you will enjoy multimedia in this device.Some Cons I feel about this device first of all is display- yes this is HD plus display in this price not even full HD resolution but overall best panel used in this device so the colours are awesome but resolution is low. Second is battery - you get a 3095 mah battery which gave me a full day battery backup with normal using , If you are using an android device with 5000-6000 MAH battery then you really need to think about this device otherwise great backup because I was using a Nokia smartphone earlier which was giving me full day battery backup so I don’t have any issue with this battery.So This Is My Experience With This Device I Like This Device and I Am Very Happy With My Purchase , Thanks To Amazon’s For Delivering Me This Great Beast ."
45,sachin sachin,Value for money,5,This is my first time where I switched to IPhone from android. I received it within two days so for delivery I am giving 5star. For packaging giving 5star. Camera is fantastic but totally disappointed with apple because not giving charger and earphones where we are paying big amount . Overall everything is fine.

48,Abhishek,Honest review. Must read. Timely updates,2,"Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..Update: phone is working good the way i use it my phone is still at 100% capacity.. daily avg use is 2:30hrs to 4:15hrsI have not installed any google apps at all. And no streaming appsOnly work and paytm and banking appsWith social media apps excluding facebookUpdate #2 it is almost a year now and my bettery health is still at 100%. i charge at 30% and till 82-86%no fb snapchat or any google app. PEACE.Update #3 1year 6+months battery health at 97% because i was using mobile data in outside weather condition feels a bit heated at times but its because of the ios update but doing fine. PEACE."
49,Rajkumar Senapati,"Great phone , Very tough exchange process",5,"PROS :1. Excellent phone with sleek screen2. Excellent battery lasting more than a day3. Face recognition is smoothCONS:1. Just the exchange process is very very complexIf you are exchanging an old phone strongly recommend not to do so. If you wish to do so here are the steps1. Please take complete back up in advance of the phone you like to exchange2. Erase all data except Amazon app. Even if you have the Amazon app on a different phone, please have Amazon app installed on the phone which you are going to give away3. Once the delivery agent comes to you, ask for a pin 6 digit number.4. You have to first enter the six digit number on the phone in the Amazon app on the order. Yes, this has to be keyed in on same order you had made and there is a provision space to enter on same.5. This step is quite complex but this is done for security to ensure you exchange the right phone.6. Once validated (Takes about 10 to 30 minutes depending on data / passwords you have stored) you then have to provide a 6 digit OTP which you would have received on your mobile and email.7. Then the agent verifies the 6 digit OTP on his device.8. If this gets done, PLEASE ENSURE YOU REMOVE YOUR SIM , DELETE THE AMAZON APP AND DATA FROM THE device you are going to give away.9. Final but most important - ensure the device is deleted from iCloud if you are exchanging iPhone . If non iPhone ensure you format the phone and ONLY THEN HAND IT OVER TO DELIVERY AGENT.10. In any possibility it would take 10 to 45 minutes to complete the exchange steps above depending on your data on phone plus the support of delivery or customer service.I had to wait for 24 hours to re do all steps and then went for it as I urgently needed this phone. Else best to exchange in a store nearby and just go for phone.SUMMARY:GREAT PHONE, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE BY CALL CENTER FOLKS, GREAT EXCHANGE PRICE BUT EXTREMELY TOUGH EXCHANGE PROCESS."
50,Nikhil ck,It’s Apple so wats their comment here.,5,"Using frm Apple 3,5s gold, 6s space gray 6s gold , 8s black, XS space gray, 11 and now with 13 pro green."
51,Mithun Dasgupta,For android users... don’t switch.. for iPhone users it’s an upgrade,4,"Honest review- I upgraded from one plus three and after much contemplation and money calculation I bought iphone11 for a discounted price.. now coming to the reviewCameraAwesome, few new features where you can change the background light is impeccable but having said that if you zoom the pix they appear a bit grainy.BatteryFor normal Facebook Watsapp news usage it will last you a day but the charger is not a fast charging one which is a big big let down...having spent so much you expect fast charging atleast.. had to buy a new fast charger you know one plus 3 kind of makes you nostalgic abt this particulr featureProcessor- is ok.. for a layman like me u wouldn’t feel the difference between An iPhone processor or a snapdragon 865+. So it’s fine haven’t played games so can’t complain or commentFor making the best use of this phone you should have AirPods since they give u iPhone specific connector type earphones which is fine but you just can’t pick any 3.55 mm jack earphone and use it. This phone makes you work hard.. like u want to use the watch app but you need to get one!!! 💁🏼‍♂️...TouchI think my one plus does well farely  better than iPhone 11It’s little hard to navigate maybe after sometime I get hang of itI would say with these features it should cost around30-40k.And I do t know why ppl praise it so much I think the guilt of having spent so much eggs them to say and write positive things only.All in all for all the android users you re not losing out on anything major, you are better off without an iPhone!I am still using my one plus 3"
52,Amazon Customer,Its superb except the Battery heatup.,5,"Other than battery heating up, other features all are fine. Due to low budget, opted for 64GB. That’s the only constraint I am facing as a nature lover to do photography and get sufficient storage."
53,Akhilesh,Overall good but overpriced.,4,I was android used moved from pixel 2xl to iPhone 11 as per my budget.Its been more than 1 week I’m using this as a my daily driver smartphone.Whats i noticed here is:1. Overall its a good phone but screen display is not oled or amoled so it doesn’t feel premium display. Even my pixel2xl display is better than this.2. Battery backup is also average its same like my pixel 2xl phone.3. Performance and speed is so good.4. Software experience is very nice but ui customisation is limitation. My pixel win here.5. Great camera little bit better camera as compare to my pixel phone but pixel is 3-4 year old phone. Still great camera it has.6. I bought this phone because I wanna experience ios os features.7. Designs is ok but not so wow kind of in this 2020.8. Hardware quality is premium.9. Overpriced smartphone I personally think.10. I feeling looted because i have so much better options in android less than 60k price.11. Display does matter so i will suggest don’t buy this phone go for Oneplus or samsung.12. Faceid is useless sometimes in night or some place its not working properly everytime showing face at some angle is freaking process. Why they aren’t providing touchid side by side like android phone.13. I’m happy with this phone quality but not happy with this 60k price point.I personally feel this phone isn’t a 2020 generation phone guys.Because we have full screen and best display with 90hz refresh rate with less tha 60k price point so why u wanna buy this phone only for chipset and camera and nothing else.I will suggest don’t buy this phone its not 2020 generation phone.
54,Abhishek,Good phone but think carefully before buying,2,"My rating for iPhone 111- Screen 4/5 - having good quality LCD screen with less PPI but no where compared to modern high PPI amoled panels.2- Camera- 5/5 -  just great.3- Built quality 5/54- Call/ voice -5/5- no issue at all.5- Face id- 3.5/5 -  no where compared to physical finger print reader, 20% times it fails to recognize your face and unlock process is itself not so smooth as you have to tap screen then swipe up to unlock where as for finger print reader just tap on reader and it unlocks the phone instantaneously. During Covid time, wearing mask and unlocking phone is so much pain as every time you have to remove your mask to get the face id work.6- Battery/ charging- 4.5/5 - battery is good, giving me 1 full  day backup in moderate use with more than 6 hr. SOT.7- Charging- 2/5 - it is weird that this 65K mobile supports fast charging but Apple is not giving 18W charger in the box, charging process is so slow and it takes like 3 hr to full charge with given charger, I use my ipad's 10W charger and it takes like 1.5 hr to full charge.6- Software- 4.5/5, iOS is smooth and using it is very pleasing experience but if you are switching from Android you will find some restrictions like can't direct trasfer files/photo/music/ videos via USB. Also I am missing call recording, duel app support and a physical finger print reader. Due to notch top status bar area is very limited, it would be great if we can see battery percentage and data speed in status bar.----overall It is a great phone but my advice is that  think twice before buying this expensive phone, as Amazon is no longer accepting return request.----"
55,Deepak,Battery gets a bit bad after 2 years but okay,5,Excellent
56,Dhivakar,Most Value for money Iphone right now !,5,"I've been using this device since last 3 weeks and the experience has been great, I had 6s for the last 2 years and upgrading from it to 11 is just something else.Touch ID has been replaced with Face ID and it's quite handy but not during this pandemic since well all wear masks Face ID sucks at recognising you.Battery life is just phenomenonal considering what I've been getting on 6s was mere 3-4 hours but this iPhone 11 is on whole new level, Now I just charge it once a day and yes that's enough juice for the dayCameras has been the best thing of iPhones since last few years. Night mode and Ultra wide Camera is the best thing on this phone, But yes Pixel is still the king of photos in low light and Videography has been the area of iPhones !Screen is the weakest point one can argue on this device yes it's does not have to mind-boggling resolution figures but an awkward 1792*828 Res display. To be very frank you won't notice any difference while consuming content unless you put a OLED display device besides it, Ofcourse OLEDs are way better but still this display is enjoyable since apple calibrates their LCD displays precisely.OLED lovers can go for iPhone 12 !So fellas If you wanna enter Apple ecosystem with less to spend go for iPhone SE and if you wanna enjoy the latest full screen design with iOS 14 latest updates and gestures iPhone 11 is the best choiceiPhone XR not recommended since it's just way too old and not good value for money"
57,Lovelyraj,Wow,5,iPhone was best
58,Aaryan,Product is duplicate and not support apple customer service and Amazon service,4,My iPhone cable not charging apple customer services centre say data cable is fake or local last 6 month buying this phone to Amazon.Plz don’t buy Amazon because product is local and not support to us.

60,Abhishek,Switched From Samsung Note 9 ( Adequately Satisfied ),2,"Okay, So All QHD+ screen Android users like me, you will definitely notice a difference in the HD LCD panel for first 3 days of your new iPhone 11 usage but post that you will get use to it and wont be able to differentiate substantially.A 13 BIONIC CHIP was something new, wont talk about fastness or snappy features, just know that it wont lag under any circumstances.Camera is actually good and above all android users will find the output photos to  be realistic than what we usually used to see in ANDROID that means NO LEEPA POTI by default.There is a different depth that you will notice in almost all photos.Videos are Super Stable ++.Ultra wide comes in handy for good instagram shots.IOS takes a couple of days to get use to, like using whatsapp / other apps which have different approaches in selecting images from gallery etc. but its user eccentric.Battery lasts a whole one day , on papers its approx. 3100 mah but will get the work done.5w charger good for people who wake up at 7 and put their phone on charging.Built quality solid.Games run butter smooth, but not a phone for heavy Gamers.Once you get an iphone, you will automatically be tempted to enter the ECOSYSTEM, so get ready to spend bucks on Airpods and iwatch because TASHAN tabhi aayega. (also they work best together)Overall I would say you will feel missing out on ceratin features from ANDROID but you will feel plus in some aspects.And When you enter an apple showroom with an iphone in your hand, salesman jyada poochta hai. so you feel great!!All in all Buy it because more productivity and optimum usage comes when you play less games and work more with your phone."
61,Sandeep Karkhanis,Good,4,Good
62,vishalU,My first iPhone 🥰,5,Its really premium feel when you hold iphone in your hand and i loved it. Camera are super only disappointment is battery capacity is too small overall nice phone if you are android user and switch to iphone then definitely go with iphone 11 you will find night photography mode with dual camera and powerful A13 Bionic chip. If you are asked iphone 11 worth it in 2022 then my answer is definitely worth it because in india 5G are not coming in this year and you need to wait long so you will definitely buy 4g iphone if ypur budget are not a problem then definitely go with iphone 12 because iphone 12 provide best value for money in 2022. That’s my review thanks😊
63,Ankur Datta,Just awsome.no word to write and say.apple is apple.best at this price,4,"Its a great product and all the features are just awsome smooth functions and with latest ios.got this deal at 49900/- only in amazon great india sale.thanks amazon for secured and fast delivery’.The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.and if yu want to shift from android to ios this is best oppertunity with this awsome device from applePhone got delivered at 19th  October (I pre-order it on 16th OCT  at 12 am ), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone  at a great dealEvery spec of this phone is ultimate no need to further upgrade to 12 waith for iphone 13 and 14 to come bcoz till then its best product and value for money an great indian saleCons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", if you are music lovers then go for airpods pro otherwise these are  good2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.or 12W charger I am using my ipad 12W charger to chage this and it charge my phone full in 1hr 15min which is great so better to buy 12W OR 18W original charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like ipad).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.Its just woooowTHANKS APPLE"
64,Mirza Zeeshan,Incredible Phone,5,"Bought this in August 2021, and it’s the best phone I’ve ever had. Transitioning from Android to iOS was smooth, this phone is much easier to navigate and use. Camera is great.Buying an IPhone 11 in 2022 is definitely worth it, especially at the current price point.But please avoid buying it from the seller ‘Darshita Electronics’ , they messed up my exchange offer process and I got the phone delivered only 2 days after original date."
65,EtherNet,Very nice,5,Happy
66,Abhishek,Expensive but worthy,2,"Camera was very good, stunning battery life, excellent display, smooth UI, has everything one asked for, only cons headphones and charger no included in box,"
67,Vicky,Amazing performer | Great photos | Good battery | Above Average Screen,5,"I am moving from iphone 8 to iphone 11 and its a worthy upgrade. Even though my iphone 8 is still good and fast, I love using my iphone 11. Its a 85% iphone 11 pro at 65% of the price. So, in apple terms it is value for money.The good:- Fast processor! Same as iphone 11 pro/pro max- Awesome camera's (Again same as iphone 11pro and pro max except for the telephoto lens which can zoom 2x). Captures amazing low light pics. Ultra wide pics are good too! Best video camera ever in a phone.- Great battery backup. Lasts me a day. 1 hr gaming. A lot of browsing and chatting and some location tracking and still 15% at EOD.- iOS 13 is now mature and awesome to use. moved seamlessly from my iphone 8.The not so good:- Screen. Well its not an OLED! But still decent enough. Decent to look at. You wont feel its bad but its not great!- Front camera is only above average. Doesnt have a night mode. And the images are decent but not great again. Front wide angle is a joke.- 5W charger in box! Apple, I cannot hate you enough for this. You sell a 70k rs phone and give us a slow charger.UPDATE AFTER 1 YEAR with the device:- Still as good as new. No issues whatsoever. Used to play Pubg pre ban and it could run the highest settings without any lag!- The performance is great in all aspects even after an year.- I dropped it in sea while playing in Feb 2020 and found it after 20 mins. It survived 20 mins under 4 feet of salt water!!! I just washed it under fresh water as soon as I found it to remove salt from it, no issues faced whatsoever. It has been 8 months since that incident but the phone is doing great, infact as good as new!!!- Cannot think of an issue that I can highlight. Probably the lack of night mode in front camera is one but I dont use front camera that much so I am happy."
68,Avinash Mottee,First time ios user,5,After 5 months my iphone is stuck to lock screen three times in 10days.I am first time ios user software wise it didn’t go to level Apple promising.Hardware wise it is prfect.Overall Apple experience is average for me.
69,Puneet,Easiest Phone to Review. Read further to get the gist,4,"Pros :-Great camera! The best ever. You don’t need to word hard to get the best shot. The image stabilisation is brilliant. The improved version gives you a perfect wide angle shot with option to increase or decrease depth in portrait mode.-LCD screen has no issues in performance and you will not notice any difference between OLED and this one. Bezels are visible but you will probably learn to live with it.-Blazing fast! This is the fastest processor/chipset so no lags in multiple app usage-Improved Battery which runs for good 15-18 hrs on medium usage-Games run insanely well with high end graphics-Wireless Charging-Beautiful design and ease of usage with a good sound reproduction from speakers than earlier iPhonesCons:-Wifi is slow and for some reason it doesn’t agree with 5Ghz band (which is the latest wifi version) so if you have 2.4 GHz then cool-Night Mode in camera sucks. One Plus 8 easily wins, even one plus 6T outperforms it in night mode.-Slow Charger in box still 5Watt so you have to buy another fast charger if u need. That is also slow ans gives you about 70% charge in 30 mins while on one plus you can get it to 90%-No 5G but still usable device as it will receive at least next 4 software updates-60Hz screen refresh rate. This is not a problem but Samsung and One Plus have upgraded to 90-120 and I don’t know why apple is being stupid on this-No screen guard or silicone back cover included in box-Best Photos need ambient light and poor performance in low light conditions. Tone becomes warmer and photos look more Yellow/Pale-Some useless pre loaded apps about 5-10Gb-True Black Experience is not there. OLED users who wanna switch might find it less pleasing."
70,Pratik,Everything is good except the battery backup.,4,"Everything is good except the battery backup. People are now more dependent on their mobile using it for mails, calls, messages, map, social media etc., it will be used throughout the day and cannot be looking for charging it twice a day. Apple need to look into this."

73,Rajiv Verma,Amazing experience,5,Little bit issues with proximity sensor otherwise fantastic phone
74,Ayush,Wonderful phone at given price,5,"I am writing this review after thorough use of phone and checking all the features for more than a month.The Pros:- Amazing back camera quality-Face ID is lightening fast. You won’t even know that a lock is there. All the banking apps integration with face time helps a lot and will refocus the need to remember password or MPIN.- iOS is beautifully designed- integration with Other Apple devices like Apple Watch, iPad and Mac. All the clicked photos instantly available iPad is wonderful feature.- They have focused very well and small things which improves the overall use experience greatly. For example, Photo management and features like geotagging, photo captions to search a photo easily.- Screen quality is wonderful and the PPI ratio is just perfet. Don’t listen to people complaining about it not having an OLED.- Even with 5W charger, the charging speed is fast and battery back up is excellent.- Lots of cases available ;)Cons:- Front camera is average.- Certain restrictions are there in iOS. Ie. File system and media management- I am facing an issue where when upload or download is going on in IGTV or Telegram, when I switch to other app, the download pause immediately. I have to keep the screen and app on.- No 3.5mm headphone jack- Apple gives only 5GB of iCloud storage. So if you are having multiple devices that Back Up on iCloud, you’ll have to buy extra space (Rs 75 per month for 50GB)Overall a wonderful purchase. Go for it."

80,Anjali,Great iPhone,4,"After analyzing for many months, finally took the decision to buy my first IPhone from Amazon. Kudos to Amazon, seller & delivery partner in prompt delivery as promised & in perfect condition. Below is my quick review after a month of usage -Pros1. Premium feel at hand & ease of use especially after coming a decade of being Android user.2. No battery heating or draining. Lasts for about 3days with very casual usage - office call, mails, few apps. Please note i have not installed any games or heavy intense apps.3. Camera quality is the best that i have experienced.4. Face ID works like charm & very useful in authentication while installing apps or view the notifications on lock screen.5. Call quality, data connection & connectivity felt immediately better compared to my earlier phone.Cons1. Only nick picking on the charger not being provided in this new version. IF you have any USB C charger at home, you can leverage the same to charge this phone since USB C cable is provided.2. Cannot use 3.5mm jack based headsets. Need Bluetooth headset or lightening port connectors.Per my experience, I would definitely recommend iPhone11 since i do not see any potential cons. I do not miss the 120Hz refresh or amoled screen while using the phone."
81,rasika s.,Literally I’m very satisfied.,4,"I have used iPhone 11 since 3monthIt gives me a smooth experience with beautiful premium feel and good Camera quality. iPhone 11 runs one day very easily (I’m a medium to moderate user) .A13 Bionic chip works very well in gaming multi tasking and it’s also power efficiency.I had an android phone user , but I hade ipad since 3 years (Not new in iOS ) .I have purchased it in sale around 39k price .You can go for iPhone 12  for getting a beautiful display experience. iPhone 11 display not bad , it beats with 25k flagship android display."
82,kashyap bhanderi,Just go for it,4,Don’t go to bad reviews. I got genuine iPhone 11 . It’s best
83,Sambasiva Rao ,My first iPhone,5,"I bought this a few weeks ago from Amazon. The packaging that it came in was tamper proof, so that was good. If it had been tampered with, you will know.The phone itself is good. 64 gb should be enough if you don’t store movies on your phone or take a lot of pictures and videos and don’t game. Out of the box you have around 40gb free. The display is good, battery life is excellent. It’s a well engineered phone with quality components on the inside. The gps lock on during map use is also fast and precise. I’ve got no complaints with this phone."
84,Abhishek,Best,2,Best iPhone
85,Saikat Pramanik,Was on the verge of nervous breakdown before opening the package,5,"Like most of the people i too was worried about the product. What if i get a clone or soap or shampoo etc. Well nothing that happened and a beautiful phone was waiting inside. Packing was normal, nothing extraordinary yet secured one with pin and code thats need to match with the shipment. Thank you AMAZONComing to the phone, well what can i say, the moment i opened the box there was an instant connection, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.The phone is incredibly beautiful.Well am an android user for the past 7 years and this being my first ios device it felt nice.Having some problem but i think thats natural, will be getting used to ios very soon.Camera is awesome, night photography , dynamic range, you can never go wrong with this.With A13 bionic chip its still one of the best chip in the market, its smooth like butter.Multitasking is smooth with this. SOUND quality is awesome, you will not complain its crisp and loud.Battery life is good, one can get a full day back up easily with normal usage.The thing that needs to be kept in mind, this phone is slippery and one needs to get a back cover and the screen guard to protect it from fall and scratches.Will be updating more with coming days.......🙂"

88,Asif,Review after 1 week of use,5,"I was a bit skeptical about the mixed reviews in Amazon. And fake iPhones getting delivered from Amazon in youtube. I ordered from the seller Darshita Electronics, this is my review after a week of use.The iPhone is genuine without a doubt thanks to Darshita electronics for that, and i got a 1 year in box warranty too, confirmed this from the apple care website.This is a great phone with minimal flaws.The build quality is very premium as you expect it from apple, The Videos are great, very impressed wit the night mode for photos. Performances is great all of the apps works flawlessly without a single lag. Face id works perfect in dark roomsThe small features apple provides like the keypad tone, ios14 features, shortcuts, siri and most importantly i don’t have to share my data with google you have a secure iCloud for that all this and more made me love this phone completely.The cons are the charger, it charges pretty slow with the 5w charger almost 3 hrs. And apple pushing you to buy their product’s like the apple watch or the airpods or a better fast charger in that case.Since the earphone in the box and charger have lightning cable you can't use earphones while charging.If you’re looking for a 1st time apple experience i suggest you go for it you will never regret.Peace"
89,Akash dabade,Nice phone.....but a little wider.......,4,Very wide phone.... have to expand hand wide everytime while holding..... Phone heats quite a bit during multitasking
90,Abhishek,Worth it !!,2,"I have purchased this phone from amazon praying that i works fine as i receive the product as there is no return or replacement policy applicable for this. I am very fortunate that i received the product on scheduled delivery date in perfectly working condition and a most importantly a genuine one.Coming to the performance - i upgraded from iphone 6, so i felt the performance is super fast considering the 4GB ram. The camera quality is top notch. FaceId also works in low/dim light and is super fast and detects if your eyes are open/closed before unlocking the phone.The aspect i liked the most was was the notification message security, the message doesnt show up until u authenticate with faceid.The screen size is really cool.The downside i felt was with the thickness of the phone, my iphone 6 is super thin and this one felt little more bulkier. Felt even more bulkier after i added the case and screen gaurd.The battery backup is quite good, i got a whole day with wifi on and with some videos on youtube and calls over whatsapp and cellular n/w.Over all i give the 3.5 out of 5 considering the cost and the features it comes with. But remind yourself thats it an IPHONE !! You have to be ready to pay that much for it considering the quality and security that comes with it. ❤️ Apple 🍎"

92,Shilpi Singh,Terrific purchase: iPhone 11 White 128GB,4,"This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes.But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy.1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget.2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11.1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging."
93,Rohi,Worth buying since it's an Apple product,5,Pros1. It's an Apple product2. Camera's - I even shot 3 shortfilms with this phone itself and output is really awesome3. A13 Bionic chip - best processor in market - No lags4. IOS - I don't have to tell it since everyone knows about it5. Retina display is so good to useCons1. Battery life - since it's an Apple product2. Lightning cable - please change it to Type C for easy accessibility3. No expandable storage since it's an apple product and the storage is not enough for me4. No customisation since it's an apple product - U can't get any apps outside playstore - you have to pay for many things5. Charging Speed - atleast they should provide a fast charger for this price range - Oops they've even removed it now

96,Abhishek,All that you need,2,"I had an iphone plus and wanted to upgrade. Did consider Oneplus 8 pro, Galaxy s20 etc.. But then, I don't need all the fancy these phones offer. I never play any games and hardly watch high resol videos. So, my priority were and what this phone offered,- Good Call quality- Decent Battery life- Fast Charging (fed up of iphone 7 plus slow charging). Buy separate adaptor and charging is fast and good. Out of the box adaptor can go directly to dustbin- Durability - i plan to keep this for next 3 years at least. My iphone 5s is still a solid backup phone, which is 6+ yrs old- Big enough to have a good read of news, watsapp etc- Decent enough display. I don't watch movies etc on phone. Good enough for normal use- Decent camera - i am more of DSLR guy, hardly use mobile. But camera on these are exceptionally good. You can refer some youtube video.So, Iphone 11 has all this and more than enough for my daily needs. i don't miss extravagant display etc, may differ user to user. Secondly, I have Mac, so its better mix with smooth airdrop etc.If you are ardiant apple user, i don't think you will like Android interface overall, no matter how fancy they are. I have used and got back to iOS."
97,Kevin,Way better than other iPhones. Go for this phone you'll love it,5,"This phone is a great option for those who are Apple lover. Feels good when in hand. Size of the phone is quite normal although it is far better than other iPhones like 11pro and XS. I had an option between 11 and 12mini but I opt for 11 as it is the best iPhone Apple has created yet. Camera quality is good as always, display and sound is awesome. I somewhere felt that battery life should've been better but although still it is better than other iPhones. For people who are confused between this and any other phone, if you have this budget, surely go for this, You'll love it. Hope you've a great day ❤️ ॐ"
98,Piyush sachan,The most perfect Apple iPhone today. No doubt.,5,"This was a dream come true for me. Apple iPhone 11 was on my wishlist for long. The phone was delivered to me neatly packed without any damage.  The phone was absolutely new piece. The phone is working perfectly and smoothly. The iPhone 11 offers excellent battery life for the form factor it is. I do not need to charge it frequently and it is lasting me the entire day with a single charge even though I use it moderately from making calls, to taking pics, to gaming and browsing web on Safari. Finally listening to music before calling it a day. At the end of the day the battery percentage remains near 14%- 20%. This wasn't the case with my previous Samsung Galaxy S6 & S7 which hardly lasted even half a day on full charge.The bundled charger is sufficient for my needs. Though the 5W charger is small and ancient it is ok as I charge it only once in a day. If you want fast charging you may have to buy the 20 W charger and cable separately from Apple. Also the bundled earpods are good, though I do not use them but my wireless headphones. Technically you cannot fault the iPhone for performance. Anything you throw at it, it performs more than your expectation. Calls, gaming, 4G, video, facetime, photos all performed excellently. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it."
99,Pravi Gupta,Amazing Phone and Superb delivery By Amazon and the seller,5,"First and foremost, I would like to talk about the seller, as I have seen many reviews on Amazon stating that don't buy an iphone on amazon or from this seller. The product delivery was really fast and I got the phone within 2 days of ordering it. Got the 128gb variant for 65000 rupees during the prime days sale. The phone was in perfect condition and brand new. I was a bit concerned after reading so many reviews on amazon that this seller can't be trusted but I will advise you to go for it.Now about the iphone, The white colour looks amazing. This is my first iphone and I'm writing this review after using it for around 10 days.The camera quality of this phone is superb and low light photos are just amazing, don't even try to compare it to the one plus or the high end samsung phones, they are no where near the camera quality of this iphone.2nd Photo is a low light photo taken by this iphone.The Battery backup is decent.The Sound Quality is nice.Face recognition is really fast.Screen is amazing and you definitely don't miss the oled screen, if you are not a big tech geek, you won't even notice the difference in your day to day life.Overall, I am totally satisfied with my iphone and you can go for it without any second thoughts.Hope this helps ! ✌🏼"
100,Sharath N,Best value for money iPhone.,5,As for now It is a best value for money iPhone. If you want to experience iphone with a modern looks you should go for this. If camera is not your number one priority then it will be a good choice for you. Dont get me wrong. Camera of iPhone xr is good enough but you will not get wide angle shots so if potrait and wide angle shots are your priority then go for iPhone 11 instead. Battery life is good and give me a good battery life for a day. I can say if your budget is tight and around 30 to 35k only then go for this.
101,Nilay Kambli,Only Cons,5,"People who buy it why they are getting it so I will only come to help you make a better decision.1. You will have pay addition money 2k for the charger.2. Many things like sharing stuff will only work with only apple devices.3. This is quite strange but I found Samsung one ui gesture control better then iPhone.4. Not a HD screen and notch could bother some people.5. Face ID doesn’t work with masks6. I having windows laptop which doesn’t have usb c, there is no way to sync with iTunes. Without spending more in a convertor.7. Camera has no quality setting for still images.These are the few things that bothered in witching few days of purchasing it."
102,Abhishek,Nyc quality,2,
103,Mohammed Aqueel,One of the best SmartPhone buy in 2020,5,"They say 'the Worlds best phone' don’t need any reviews. But still, I would like to share my experiences..I bought Iphone 11 White color 64Gb variant during the Amazon Oct Festive offer,It was delivered on time.There were limited color option because most of them were sold out or unavailable due high demand this days, but I do not regret, in-fact, I am happy with this color. Believe me or not, Iphones in white coming from there initial models like 4s and till date are Apples top selling - they looks classy & feels rich. White color does stand out professional.I almost grabbed this deal 47999 offer + additional 1800 off on HDFC card which bring down the price to almost 46200.This phone is super smooth, it gives an immense multitask and user interface experience. The other thing that makes me feel great is its Battery Life. This is a huge improvement done in any iPhone models till date.Camera is another best thing of iphone 11.Talking about the design and build quality, it is great. The Aluminum Build and Glass back make this device stand out in crowd.Apple have improved the sound & audio quality as-well. It has got the stereo speakers. The output is very balanced, loud and clear.Thanks to Amazon for there great service and deals they offer. Highly recommended!"
104,Siddhartha N.,Worth the money. A Lag free experience!,5,"I bought this iPhone a week ago and although this might be a review done too soon but I know that this phone never disappoints. There are a lot of good phones at a lesser price like oneplus 8 and samsung s20 but if you want a a lag free experience and a simple OS performance - go for the iPhone.I also read a lot of negative reviews about the seller but it was a secured and happy experience for me! Appario did a good job here!Pros:1. A13 bionic chip - Smooth OS with no lags and top of the line processor2. If you're purchasing this for gaming - I did for PUBG then you won't be disappointed! The FPS and gaming experience is surreal3. Speakers are of excellent quality and are quite loud4. Camera does a more than decent job with the night mode being a stand out!Cons:1. Battery is one thing iPhone really needs to take care of! 3200 MAH won't let you go a long time without charging2. The LCD panel is not that great when compared to oneplus 8, lacks in screen refresh rate too with a 60Hz screen refresh rate3. The charger is a slow charger and takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device."
105,Gaurav Dubhele,Very Smooth device..,3,"Everything is fine as expected from Apple. Camera is really good. The processor is fast. COD runs smoothly even at highest resolution with highest frame rates. Display is good, though its not an amoled screen or O-led, but the screen is bright enough under sunlight.  The charger provided is a 5watt charger, which takes around 2 hour 30 minutes to charge the battery from 15% to 100%. User has to be a little careful with the battery. Heavy user will have to charge the device twice a day. After using Anroid for all these years it actually quite interesting to use an iOs device. Security on the device has to be mentioned. The face lock works seamlessly, even in pitch dark conditions. Everytime an app is downloaded, face recognition is must. Sharing of photos and documentaries is actually not tough these days with so many applications available. I am having a great time with my 1st ever Iphone. I might not go back to anroid device again if this device runs good for the next 3 years. Thank you Amazon for such quick delivery within 24hours. The seller Appario Retail private ltd has done a great job in terms of packaging and on time delivery."
106,getrajan1,Worth to take a chance,5,"So I'm writing this review after using 3 months. Basically I'm 1st time using iPhone. I was bit afraid to take a risk with this phone but now looks worth to wait.Battery life is good. You can use whole day without playing games. For normal uses one time charging will be enough. The phone will get charge full within 1 hour.Camera : As everyone knows camera quality of the iPhone. It's tremendous.Display : Missing Amoled, but you'll not see any difference.Gaming experience is good. You'll not feel any lagged or anything. It runs smoothly.Build quality is superb."
107,Ajay Katal,Better,5,Original product
108,Abhishek,Best ever,2,"Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys!!"
109,Sanidhya,Honest review why should you buy this.🙂,5,As expected From Apple everything feels primium. First time in my life I bought iPhone it feels sturdy and comfortable. Not too big not too short for my hands perfect feet as always Cameras are grade. I want to mention if any one wants to buy iphone for camera please do check-out Samsung S series also as Today in 📷 competition samsung S20 Ultra is best in camera than newly launched iphone 12 pro max. If you ar buying for video then go for iphone 12 series. And if you are a gamer and want to buy this phone then nice decision do for it just how many android gaming Phone came out no one can beat iphone in PUBG MOBILE gaming experience there absolutely no frame drop not a single till now. But In android there will be always this issue. I want to say if you want both performance and camera together to for it or only for gaming go for Xr. Iphone 11 not recommended Xr is less price and there is no such performance diff. Don't upgrade iphone until a big change not made my apple.like better refresh rate and ibuild PRO mode in camera more customisation options. Like that in INDIA didn't expect 5G till 2023 so that's why.Thank you 😊For reading my review.☮️ Out.✌️
110,Prakash,Super,5,Love it iPhone
111,Subodh G.,"Face recognition, camera quality, processor performance & battery life are way better. Go for it.",5,"Due to existing COVID situation, my phone got delivered 2 days late. Amazon team ensured and took care of quality delivery. There are lots of negative review for buying iPhone 11 from Appario retail. Even I had my doubts but after having words with Amazon customer care & their assurance, I went for it. As soon as I received the product, I registered it online for validation. Even you should do it first. I had no issues with my phone. I rigorously used it for few days & only then sharing the feedback. Face recognition, camera quality, processor performance & battery life are way better. You will like it.Design is good, though the phone seems bit heavy.When I unboxed my iPhone, I found: regular Lightning cable, a pair of EarPods ending on a Lightning plug, and 5W charger. Though iPhone 11 supports 18W fast charging through USB Power delivery, it is not bundled with the new 18W Apple charger that comes with the Pro models. You will have to buy it (12 watt or 18 watt charger) separately, if you want to charge your phone quickly.  Some other good features: - Stereo speakers with great quality. - iOS provides smooth user experience. - The main camera produces very good photos, Night Mode works good. - Amazing video quality - Excellent selfie photos.Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase of mine."
112,Satya,A good deal if under 45K,5,"Iphone 11 is a great phone if you get it under 45kI’ll describe my review in pros and consPros:1. Amazing camera quality2. User experience is fantastic3. Processor is super-fast and multitasking is buttery smooth4. Feels premium : Design is stylish5. Timely updatesCons:1. Average battery life (typical one day usage on moderate usage)2. Need to buy a separate fast charger, charging time is damn slow with the regular one3. Feels Bulky and heavy in hand4. IPS lcd panel with retina HD resolution but screen quality not that bad (No amoled, No FHD), but considering the competition amoled should have been thereTo summarise its a great phone with amazing cameras with some cons but would surpass many android smartphones in performance and camera department in this price bracket!"
113,karthikeya.mandavilli,Good phone regular usage,5,"I bought iPhone 64 gb black after lot of research and confusion from all the products in the market.This product I got at 48500 rs.I had lot of concerns regarding the seller.But, surprisingly the phone is genuine I checked the warranty and other details everything is good.Using the phone since few days(I don’t play any games).pros1) Amazon delivered it a day ahead of the actual delivery date. The delivery was excellent.2) Very efficient battery after one full charge it lasted almost a day after mild use and no battery heating issue as of now.3) voice quality of the calls is very good. Better than the android phone that I used before.4) picture quality from this phone camera is excellent.Cons1) moving from android to apple data transfer is a bit of hassle.2) display is a little bit low compared to iphone12 mini ( which I had originally planned to buy)3) no charger adapter( big con for me moving from android to iPhone)it’s a good buy for the regular usage a very solid looking good phone."
114,Abhishek,Simply AMAZING!!!,2,"Very much satisfied about the purchase. Was a little concerned about whether I would be getting genuine product or not, but kudos to the seller (Darshita electronics), they kept my trust. Got a September manufactured made in India unit as well. Every accessory working fine and no heating issues as well. Only heats up a little with my 20 Watts fast charger. I would recommend not to use the fast charger on daily basis. It’s okay to use it sometimes when you are in a hurry. Otherwise use the regular 5 Watts slow charger. Apple has provided that because of a reason. Only concern is with apple not amazon, which is the cable quality. Very very poor quality which starts to chip off within a few months. So due to sale, i ordered the Belkin cable for charging as it is best in class and MFI certified. Would recommend to use only good quality MFI cables if you want long life for your phone. Other than that, camera quality is top notch and always seems to improve with every software update. Battery life is epic, lasts a full day although I don’t do gaming on iphone, still I am quite a heavy user.Very very happy with the purchase. Thank you Amazon and Darshita electronics. ☺️"
115,Omkar patil,Bought it at 40k,4,Good phone at 40k if you wanna spend 40k then Apple. If will justify the price
116,Nasim Ansari,Camera quality,5,"The camera quality of my apple 11 phone is getting worst and worst day by day. What is the problem behind this. Kindly provide me a new phone, as this phone is not useful to me."
117,Soubhik Roy,Worst Prime delivery by Amazon,5,"The product is cool. Camera quality is just flawless. In last 45 days usage, the screen went black automatically and after pressing power/volume buttons multiple times, it started.Amazon delivery just sucks. They delivered the product in 7 days even after having prime membership. On other hand Flipkart delivered my shoes from tier-2 town on next day without any membership/coins. Amazon need to work on its promises and need to abide by its Moto so called “the most customer centric company”."
118,Nasar,Worth the Money,5,Excellent product. Apple never fails to amaze. Brilliant phone doesn’t lag at all. Never had any issues with any Apple product for the last 7 years.
119,Gaurav Singh,Iphone vs One plus,4,"Coming from android and with no fast charging out of the box.... battery sucksCamera is awesome.... only pixels come close but this phone has an edge over every other flagship in the market.... portraits are the bestFace recognition works 2 times out of 10 in the post covid world and so yeah i miss the fingerprint scanner.Ios is 10/10 conpared to android. Gives you the premium feel.Display is something you wont complain about unless you do a side by side comparison with other phonesBuild quality is awesome but the phone slips out my hand a lot so use a bumper cover.No lagging issues..... phone heats up when doing heavy usage while charging but thats ok. All phones do that. Its a phone, not a super computer.Speakers- crazy good dual speakers but all flagships have that. Dont they?P.S. buy if you are a social media crazy kind of person and want insta ready photos straight out of your camera. If camera is not the reason for you buying the phone go for a one plus or a galaxy you will end paying less and getting much more."
120,Abhishek,Premium phone with okay discounts from HDFC.,2,"Happily upgraded my parents to an iPhone from Android.Pros:1. This is the best device in all respects. The best of the best flagship Android phones cannot match up to this one at a 46k price point. Pixel4A was a let down IMO.2. Wireless charging, NFC, nice camera, regular iOS updates, a no frills phone, IP68 rating, etc; what more can you want from your phone?Cons:1. There'd be a few surprises for a religious Android user, e.g. one cannot likely transfer files without installing iTunes. It is a breeze for general usage viz shopping, booking cabs, making payments, etc.2. It has an e-SIM for dual SIM support and as of now you can only use AirTel or Jio e-Sim in India. The perils of getting one is a bit complicated but we'll documented.3. The Apple ecosystem is a trap, once you are in it'd be super hard to get out for really good reasons. You might end up buying lots of iProducts and burning a lot of money, so proceed with caution.4. Read the terms and conditions ofApple warranty. Most likely water damage isn't covered by Apple. This isn't your phone, it's your kidney, handle with care go buy some insurance."
121,Manoj sangwan,Fantastic,5,"An absolutely fantastic piece of hardware with some super-smooth software to complement it.Absolutely no negatives so far. I am getting great battery backup of more than 36 hours with regular usage that includes a few hours of calls every day, WhatsApp, camera and Twitter primarily.Data, wifi and gps always remains on. I also did not notice much of an heating issue.It gets slightly hot when charging but only if use it while it is being charged.I either use my Mac Book's charger or charge it directly though the micro USB port on my computer.It also is reverse charge enabled, something which I was not aware of.So, I use to charge it from my big android phone also.The experience has been butter-smooth.A total value for money device."

126,Abhishek,Got genuine product from Amazon. Value for money in this price segment.,2,"I got received fresh box packing and manufacturing nov month. I heard many rumors for fake iphone delivered from Amazon.  But i don't think they do this cheap work. So without hesitate u can place order from Amazon. I have used some days this product then i feel on hand its awesome. I have listened music earphones and stereo speakers. Very loudly sound and every beats are crisp and clear.Camera quality are awesome no doubt. Display quality is decent  and battery life is also decent. Approx 1 day uses with normal uses. Face id is more secure. But i got face one issue. In this Pandemic, the mask has to come down again and again whenever the phone has to be unlocked. So they should give In fingerprint displays. This is safe feature in this pandemic.Along with the phone, they should also provide a charger. Because you take so much money, you still cannot provide charger, even that big company!Overall the phone is good, you can buy."
127,Shaizan mukhtar dar,The most eye-catching,4,"The iPhone 11 was a big surprise, packing more advanced technology (namely in the camera capabilities and the processing power under the hood) at a lower cost than the iPhone XR's price in 2018. It combines a large 6.1-inch display with a premium-feeling body, and comes in an array of colors too.The iPhone 11 isn't Apple's newest smartphone - the iPhone 12 takes that crown, launched alongside the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max. They're pretty similar smartphones in terms of design but have improved camera sensors, a newer chipset and flat, not curved, edges.The most eye-catching feature of the iPhone 11 is to the imaging capabilities: with two sensors on the rear, you can now take wider-angle snaps alongside the ‘normal’ main images. These sensors are 12MP each, and are raised from the rear of the phone in a square glass enclosure - which we’re not enamored with visually.The night mode is the most impressive part of the iPhone 11 imaging quality, bringing brightness and clarity to impossibly dark scenes, and the Portrait mode, defocusing the background, is improved on the new iPhone too."
128,Denzil D.,Yet another Iphone,3,"I bought this phone for 55k, When I first saw the phone, it looked stunning. I started configuring it it was pretty simple and easy. No doubt it was a brand new phone. I was anxious that amazon would sell me a fake iPhone in the sale as I saw many videos on youtube Maybe I was lucky. Initial 2 days I found that the mobile was heating a lot.I had read the same comments in the review also. When I consulted the apple care they told me that after first-time installation The mobile will reindex all the apps and it will optimize. They suggested me to reset and configure again. I did the same and now it works like a charm no heating issues at all.Pros :1: very smooth animation2: powerful A13 bionic chip3: Back camera is great4: Best in class sound5:Dual sim support(esim+nanosim)Cons:1:Display could have been better for this price.2: Front camera is not that good.3:battery could have at least 4000mah"
129,Yogesh,Bought an iPhone to see what all the fuss was about,4,"Reviewing after a month’s use....Pros:- Great battery life: My usage is mainly calls, mails, WhatsApp, podcasts, web browsing and social media- Satisfied with Apple’s claims about security and privacy- Works great within the apple ecosystem. Already have an iPad and AirPods and connections are seamless across products- Great for work and productivity- Siri Shortcuts is great for creating workflowsCons:- Not great for media consumption. Screen resolution is a little over 720p- Camera is great. But as of now I haven’t been able to use it to click better photos than I did on my previous phone (OnePlus 7). I don’t know, Maybe I’m using the camera wrong :P- Had to buy the charger separately :(- Lacks notification control to the extent that I want. In android I could have rules for different notifications within the same app, not possible hereHad bought it out of peer pressure to be honest...So I’m having mixed feelings about it."
130,Seikh Allauddin,Decent enough,5,It's a great product for the price I bought it for. Using various schemes and discounts I was able to get it for 30k. The problem was that I exchanged my existing phone which was an Android. Shifting data from an Android phone to an iPhone and vice versa was a pain in the ass.
131,Diya Goswami,Good,5,"To be honest, i was hesitating to order after read some negative comments. Its been one month since I ordered and Alhamdulillah it’s smooth , didn’t face any issue until now alhamdulillah. But the bill comes is not printed , it comes plain bill ! So that’s one thing bad about it"
132,Abhishek,The brand value of this phone awesome,2,"The brand value of this phone awesome…once anybody see it ,the person eye is stuck for few second and special attractive is the green premium Color. Camera is also good. UI and face unlocking is good.Battery is not so good.rest features are ok ok.Weight is more, fingers print is not there"
133,gurneet,Good phone,5,good
134,Tanmoy Paul,Battery life is not at all good,4,"as it’s IOS I have not installed multiple applications I have used for normal calls and social media apps. Battery life went to 40 percent, my suggestion is for game lovers and entertainment apps users better to go with android mobiles."
135,Adithya Gopikrishnan,payment mode disappointment,5,I am very much disappointed with my payment I have chosen for EMI mode but since full payment has 1000 discount I opted for full payment now I can see the full amount with no discount has been deducted I have rated 4 start because I am not sure if I should mention this over here.May be whole lot of confusion due to complexity of payment they created.....

I am very much happy with purchase.Thanks Amazon"

140,Yesh kumar sahu,First Time Iphone Purchase that too Online.. It was Good,4,"First Time bought an iPhone from Amazon.. Overall good experience.. Just one thing,  While placing the order I read the specifications and it was mentioned IOS 14.2 operating system but it was updated to IOS 15.. Which  I didn't wanted.."
141,Riya Ganguly,Windows phone user converted to Android user finally converted to IOS user.,5,"First time I am using an iPhone. Nowadays I was in search of the smoothness of usage of an android like my old Symbian driven Nokia N8, and failed. Decided to shift to ios and bought this with a huge discounts here. Obviously, this is the best phone I have ever used. For the android users - this os is so intuitive and predictive that you do not need to search for a particular type of phone usage."

143,Arunkumar,Best phone ever purchased,5,Hands Down Apple beats Android. I have been an Android user for all my life until now and now I realise what I have been missing out. It might take a few days to get comfortable with the new UI but it’s all worthwhile. The user experience is fabulous and the camera is almost DSLR level. Sound and video watching experience is also awesome. All in all the price is justified unlike popular beliefs where IPhone is considered overpriced.
144,Abhishek,Read this before switching from Android,2,"If are switching from Android here are the following things that will frustrate you in apple:1. Video recording doesnt have pause button2. Almost every app needs paid licence. Eg A proper pdf viewer3. Cant save files on a folder and use it in explorer.4. Settings of each app can only be accessed via settings and not the individual app. So eg if you are in camera app, need to change resolution, need to come out of it and change it in settings5. There is no select all button in most apps like messaging, gmail, gallery etc. happy ticking off each item6. Face id has this eventually annoying animation that cant be turned off.7. If you prefer call recording, it takes a periodically paid app to place a background conference call and record at its end to show your recorded calls8. The otg adapter is over 500 times more expensive than android otg adaptor.9. Similarly all accessories are more expensive than their value. They just provide a snob effect10. Sometimes you would wonder how to get to the previous screen without reaching to the far top left back button on screen. But dont worry there isnt and the gestures dont work. Eg open a product image on flipkart or amazon and try to close it. Will take some time to figure it out.11. Display resolution is nowhere close to the similar price ranged android phones12. The new back tap feature to take a screenshot etc often gets triggered when you keep the phone on a desk13. There is no keyboard that shows numbers on the top line. So we have to swap no. And letter keys. Imagine entering an alphanumeric captcha14. Cant have a blank home screen to highlight wallpaper15. No battery % on the notification bar16. If you have old mp3 songs, they cant be simply beamed from your old android to iphone, need to attach phone to a computer and import via itunes.17. And dont get me started on connecting to other phones, via bluetooth or nfc. Even if you some manage to get a file on iphone, theres a good chance itll be useless. I wanted to import contacts using vcf backups. Security that puts shackles on you own feet.18. Try changing iphone ringtone to your downloaded tune. Not possible unless we use a thirdparty app.19. Cant even select all text from a page with a single click. What is with you people and select all?But hey. I get to show off my new iphone 🤬"
145,Medha Rajak,Value For Money,5,After 1 year I must say it’s a good product. 1st I am worried about for service bcs In my Native place their is no service centre near about 300km but No worries right now. No issue till date.A product with classCamera GoodBattery full day use (without gaming)IOS superbA few things like call recording 3rd party applications if added it will take to next level
146,Deepesh(justauselessfellow),Value For Money,4,"First of all the colour of the phone itself is so comforting that I love it. When it comes to performance it is Top Notch and everyone knows how iPhone works so no doubt there. No fingerprint scanner but Face ID can work almost everywhere so you’ll face no problem there.Screen response time is very accurate there’s no delay or lag and when it comes to battery life. You can pass a day or two very easily doing normal tasks but yeah the 5W charger in the box is very slow so if you’re not getting a charger from now it’s not bad.When it comes to camera the detail and all is very accurate, portrait mode does exceptionally well and the video recording is supported up to 4K 60fps. Obviously you can’t enjoy  it in 720p screen but it’s there.So overall the iPhone 11 delivers the best value for money now that it’s around 55k so definitely if you’re going to buy your first iPhone just like me you should definitely go for it."
147,Titrus,Apple the best in its class,3,"iPhones are the most premium mobile devices money can buy. If u have a budget just go for it, You won’t regret it.Coming to iPhone 11 it’s the most affordable of the lot and feels really premium. Though it’s not 5G but it doesn’t matter 5G won’t be coming anytime soon and even if it comes it would be very expensive so one can easily go for it. Coming to the lcd screen trust me won’t notice any difference it’s Apple quality LCD and the company would not compromise on quality. Camera is best especially in the low light performance is really impressive. And coming to the battery life it’s really impressive on moderate uses u can easily get 8+ hours of screen on time."
148,Pvm,MY DREAM HAS BEEN COMPLETED❤️‍🔥😭🥳🥳,5,Thanks a lot amazon and dealer. I have purscahed the iphone 1- 128gb green colour was sa superb all of youu please don’t take any tension. By seeing reviewing they are only spreading neagtivity of amazon but i know it is best online marketing platform beacause of the amazon my dream completed today thanks a lot please don’t hesisate buy it fast from this platform❤️❤️❤️🥳
149,Shrey,Quality Product,5,"First iPhone 😍🥳 Performance, Camera , battery , build quality , top notch 🤩 the only problem i faced is heating issue while gaming otherwise best 😍 i got it at ₹40k in big billion days sale"
150,Abhishek,iOS users gotta accept it’s iPhone 11.,2,"Nothing to dislike about the product and seller.Security: I only hope that apple will come up with an iOS update to add option for those wanting to disable swipe after the phone is unlocked with Face ID.Camera quality: Could see visible grains in photos taken even during daylight as compared to the photos taken from iPhone 5s even though it’s without crisp details. iPhone 11 boasts of camera features, else the picture quality isn’t impressive. Video quality is good though.Battery: It’s not a gaming phone even though it runs popular titles smoothly. So, it will go about an entire day in moderate usage without much to play.Voice assistant: Siri is few seconds slower to respond to ‘Hey Siri.’Sound: Sounds good while watching videos. Watch videos with good quality audio in landscape mode/widescreen for better experience since it has speakers on top and on the bottom. Use EarPods/AirPods for the better.Overall, it’s a good buy in 2020 with not much to bargain for what you pay."

153,Sayan Sardar,NYC in this price,4,Battery is not working for longer day sometimes volume get automatic very low but good in this price if you want best iPhone then don’t buy in sell I think it’s use phone
154,Ayush Shukla,Great upgradation,5,"I upgraded from iPhone 6 to 11. So certainly there’s great change i can feel. Though, the look & aesthetics are pretty much same, except for a center button not being there in iPhone 11. But, i accustomed to the new system pretty easily. Rest everything else is same for aesthetics. There’s a great difference in the audio & visual quality, very good cam & the sound is too too good. It can easily beat some sound bar, or Bluetooth speakers."
155,ALRIN,Excellent!!,4,"Overall phone is excellent. You can go for it.But one suggestion to all, don't buy any products using Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card, you will be charged nicely. That too if you are choosing NO EMI COST option then gone case, get ready to pay extra charges including interest charges and GST against each installments and products. Whatever they show in calculation details (Structure) all bullshit. I nicely charged for this product by selecting EMI option and just to save 1000/- I paid extra 2000/- for this product.And I purchased one more product 'Hoodie' the cost was 799/- by using Amazon Pay ICICI Card it costed for me 942.82 including GST even though it was a one payment.So my sincere suggest don't use *Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card at all*. And don't go for any EMI options its better to buy in one payment to avoid additional charges. No body will help you once it is charged to you. ICICI Customer care they play very safe game."
156,Abhishek,Amazon is best nd their sellers are too good personally thanks to apario.,2,"First of I would like to share my experiences after placed order of Iphone 11 128 GB black mobile in sale with discount price.I was worry about product quality nd delivery because lots of negative reviews seen on YouTube nd also in this platform.Some people claimed that they received fake products or defective products so I was also lill bit tense .I placed this order dated 19.01.21 nd got my iphone 11 22nd morning , for precaution I done recording delivery process nd unboxing too .Now I can say that people shouldn't doubt on Amazon and their products which they deliver.My primary phone is iPhone 12 Pro Max nd this one is my secondary phone because it's size matters for me , very handy 6.1 inch screen size so it's comfortable to use single hand .Quality is best , battery life 100% nd camera quality is also becnchmark of this segment.Warranty is now active when activate phone.😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇"
157,RAJU KUMAR,Best phone to buy,4,Good quality Phone
158,vishal ,Worthy till now(2021) .,5,"iPhone is known for their industry leading camera performances. iPhone 11 is a great phone. A lot of  reviews out there , I don't have much to talk about. It's camera is absolutely fantastic. Nice battery backup. But when I charge it with the 20 watt power adaptor it slightly heats up the phone. That's not a big concern. It's just slightly and if you don't want that then you could use a 12 watt power adaptor as a solution. It's still a good phone in 2021 . So I highly recommend this if you want to buy ."
159,Kapil Pandey,Best in the series,2,"I am writing the review after 6 months of my purchase and it's one of the nice feelings but the only disappointment is with the camera which is not as I expected! Overall I will give the 4.5-star rating, oh ok battery shell life is also good compared to the previous generation"
160,Customer,I Phone is available easily on Amazon.,5,Very good product. Amazon is great platform to buy I phone. I phone First month working nicely but second month I faced network issues on the I phone thanks to warranty’s of Apple within a month a received the replacements of the phone.
161,Premchandra,The best overall,5,"I really like the performance while playing games, while shooting 4k videos, and the battery life. While the camera may be the best on a smartphone, sometimes i do prefer to use my professional camera, but for every other task, it is good.The video stabilisation is also the best on a smartphone but not quite on the same level as panasonic cameras.The screen, well i cant really tell any difference between this and a 1080 or 1440p screen, it's really good. The bezels on the side do stand out though (not bothered by the notch, that's functional),If you zoom out to the ultrawide while shooting videos, you do lose the good stabilisation.Overall it's a great product, it has the best processor, sufficient RAM that you won't notice, and it being an apple product will keep getting updates for a long time, making it a long lasting phone, the camera is the best in a smartphone and you will be happy using it. When you buy an apple product you pay for the software developments and updates that come with itEdit after 4 months: battery maximum capacity still at 100%, brightness might feel less in direct sunlight, I'm a heavy user but my phone lasts a whole day. If i go for an outing with photography or likewise in mind, I never have to worry about battery doing. Heavy apps like Lightroom do drain the battery somewhat."
162,Abhishek,Very good phone but not a significant improvement over the previous-gen models,2,"So, I got this phone on June 14, 2020. First impressions - It is a tad too big to my liking and very slippery. A Spigen rugged case is highly recommended.Apple should start giving different skins and themes to customise the phone. The battery life is awesome only if you keep it in low power mode. Else it will not last even eight hours. In battery saver, you can literally watch six three-hour movies. In short, a full day's work of keeping FB, Twitter, Instagram, Gmail, YouTube active can be accomplished.The charging is very slow. For a full charge from 2%, you end up wasting 3.5hrs. Apple is doing the height of chindigiri now by not providing earphones as well as the power adapter. What if I am an all-new introduction to the Apple ecosystem.I am not a fan of the camera or perhaps I am a bad photographer. Unfortunately I don't have any images on me. Lost my phone 😢. Booked another 11 though during the Great Indian Festival."
163,Anuj kumar,Best in class,4,"People might be wondering , is 64 GB enough ??It is actually more than enough if you are a normal user . You can keep photos and few games. It will not hit your storage so much .If you love to record videos especially in 4k .. Go for 256 GB version.I am a normal user and this phone is best for me"

 While other cell phone manufacturers are making tremendous headway in this space,🥰 Apple continues to lead in innovation, technology, design and practical functionality with its highly integrable iPhone line up.❤️‍🔥 Video Stabilisation is OP ❣️😍 These phones are extremely user friendly, integrate and share data seamlessly across other Apple devices and take the guesswork out how to stay connected today.🦊 The only thing I don’t like on the new design is that they no longer have a input for headphones and/or auxiliary cords. I know it’s a bit old school, but it would be nice not to be “forced” into expensive AirPods and not being able to play music if you have an older car that isn’t equipped with Bluetooth but does have an auxiliary jack.…"
165,neha,"Excellent battery, not so bad screen, slow charging, heavy phone",5,"Pros -1. All the benefits of an iPhone. (Superb ios experience, smoothness, speed, touchscreen etc etc etc)2. In this time when smartphones giving backup of 20+ hrs in a single charge are considered a good one. This phone has the best battery life in iPhones till now. It easily gives 36 hrs battery life with normal usage.3. Sound is loud.Cons:-1. Extremely slow charging:- it take approximately 3 hrs to charge this phone from 10% to 100%. You have to buy a fast charger separately. In the pack they were giving 5W charger. But i think with newer models you need to buy the brick separately as they are giving only the charging cable. You can get 20W power brick from apple website for ₹1900. That should solve this slower charging issue for you.2. Heavyweight- this phone is pretty big and heavier to hold.Iphone x - 174 gmsIphone xs - 177 gmsIphone 11 - 193.3 gmsIphone 12 - 162.4 gms"
166,Ashish Parihar,Awesome ❤️,4,"Brilliant phone with fantastic features at an unbeatable price. To all those naysayers comparing Android with iOS, I have just one thing to say - Use iOS once and then we?ll see who comes out trumps. Face ID Unlock is best in class, amazing camera clarity, super fast processor, Battery that lasts more than a day with a single charge. Do you wish for anything more? Nah. All things packed in one phone. The one, the only, the Master of all."

So, case is highly recommended.8) Same with front display. Suggest you to apply a tempered glass.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase and impressed with Amazon and Seller for this experience.PS: These are 1st impressions, I'll be reviewing it again."
168,Abhishek,Go for it 🥳,2,"This is the best iPhone you’ll ever get(Bought in amazon sale) for this price. I was afraid to order from amazon but that’s wasn’t a prob after receiving. Think twice if you’re making switch from android, coz you’ll miss lot of things when it comes to ease to use and customisations. Man you’ll feel android is cheap(except oxygen and pure android), that fluidity, damn the haptic motor (sucks in most of androids). Here comes the big surprise for me, the “Battery” backup is great for an iPhone which i didn’t except. It gives you 1 and half to two days  of normal usage. It gets warm and bit hot when you play games and sucks the juice fast. Animations are smooth as hell and you don’t need to worry about OS upgrades for at least 4 years in which apple is shines keeping their old devices updated. Be ready burn your pockets coz slowly you’ll get into apple ecosystem which feels convenient and awesome. Will update after six months."

 Finally bought this for my lil bro. He's been wanting to buy an iPhone since many years now. Finally with good discount we bought this. The phone feels amazing to hold in hand and use. The dimensions of the phone are so properly designed that you can easily use with one hand. The camera is amazing even on this as well. The screen despite of being LCD is very good to look at and iOS is very fluid and smooth. Overall battery performance is good for medium user to kind of heavy user. The white colour looks amazing. Do buy 20w charger or else it will take hours to charge your phone with the charger which comes inside it. Now the shortcomings of moving to iOS from Android - the app available from Apple to transfer data may or may not work. And there's literally no Free way to transfer data apart from physically transferring everything to your laptop and then again transferring to iPhone. The dual SIM usage might be a trouble for you if you are switching from latest Android to iOS. Whole texting and calling. Perhaps it will take some time to getting used to. Overall if you love iOS or always wanted iPhone this is a good one better that XR and definitely than SE. If budget permits go for 11 pro/11 pro max."
170,Rohit chauhan,Good battery and Camera,4,my review after using 10 days.The camera was very nice to click some best pics.Special night mide feature gives you the best shots in night times.battery backup was just decent for my usage it’s giving a two days backup for me.

173,Nitin G.,Entered the apple eco system,5,I bought it from the seller darshan !! My first iphone ; no issue of hanging and all that.Was working smoothly.but rest is like bliss.After 3months use:In my case its genuine phone no issue on hanging and all that.Apple has some standards which are above every phone maker.I own a mac also and seamless connection in between both.Battery backup is quite not upto the mark but 20watt charger does the work pretty well.
174,Abhishek,Worth the money!,2,"I bought this on 05th of August,2021. This is my first iphone. Before this I was using OnePlus 7. The one plus 7 after using for 1.5 years started to hang quite often thereby reducing the overall performance. Prior to one plus 7, I've used one plus 5 for 2 years. Battery draining was a major issue for both of these. I wanted to buy Iphone. Battery backup is better than One plus phones. Obviously this is at par with one plus when it comes to overall performance. I'm having ipad also and the battery backup of the ipad is also good."
175,Amazon Customer,Defective product,5,"Actually I ordered iphone 11 64 gb on 6th oct and the delivery was at 7th oct. On 7th oct I didn’t got the product as they said there’s something technical issue in exchange same on 8,9,10,11th oct. Then at 12 oct amazon reordered the product and i got it on 13th oct . But when I open the product there was a issue in rear wide angle camera as ig was blurry and foggy . So i gave a complaint on it and asked for the replacement of product,they said it’s not our concern you have already got a replacement product. Then on 14th oct they said talk to apple service centre and bring a job sheet regarding it and we’ll give you a replacement. So when I bought the job sheet and asked for replacement they we’re like we can’t help you we will not give you a replacement. One of the worst service given by amazon.. @amazon.in"
176,Ankit,Excellent phone (even in comparison to iphone 12 when you consider the price.),5,"I got it for 48.5k (128 GB version) and at this price point its a an excellent product (compare it with oneplus 9 but will beat it on performance, longevity and camera from in case if these are your priorities). Its a real value for money when compared to iphone 12 mini (upwards of 65K+ for 128GB but smaller battery) and iphone 12 (80k+ for 128GB variant). You wont miss much on camera and performance front. True that the new boxy design is sexier and the screen has improved. But the premium you have to pay is too big (around 20k).P.S: I would strongly suggest to go for 128 GB version irrespective of the version of iphone. 64GB is too less and you will start to encounter space issues within six months or so (if you are a casual user)."
177,VINOTHSINGH,IPhone11 - value for money,5,"iPhone11 is my second apple product which I purchased recently after iPad Air and as I am pretty happy with iPad I really felt of switching to iPhone from android. iPhone11 is absolutely working fine for me and the battery lasts longer, Face ID to irks very fast and the apps do respond quickly even with 10 or more apps in open. The Face ID which is being used to login to apps work perfectly  and I could open locked mobile or the apps very much conveniently. A little bit of heat happens to occur when I charge the mobile but that’s normal not to the extreme . I am happy with the product… I continue to go with Apple products going further. It’s value for the money …"

179,Sunny,Apple is awesome,5,Love d phone. Buttery smooth. Nice battery backup. Up to date software.
180,Abhishek,I just love iPhone 11 !!!,2,"The only word to use for this Phone would be ""Perfect"". It's a perfect piece of art. I was fed up from using android phones and just wanted to move to the ios Platform. I was confused Between iPhone X and iPhone 11 and after a lot of Research and Youtube Searches, I Chose iPhone 11 and trust me it was one for the best decisions of my life. The UI is super smooth, the Build quality is amazing and the camera is just beauty. I am just falling in love with this phone. Although its a little bit costly but trust me its worth spending money on this piece of tech.Pros -- Camera is Amazing- Water-resistant- 4K Recording- Fluid Smooth touch- Never Lags in Heavy Gaming- And 100s of more ProsCons -- Haven't found any yet !!!So if you want to Switch to ios platform from android then just go for it and Chose iPhone 11 as your next device."
181,sohan singh,Value for money,4,"Value for money, nothing is better than the iPhone. I am the first time user of iPhone pre io was using android and before buying the iPhone 11 I also have any doubts in my mind like battery life and all but seriously on a single change you will get the entire day. ( Note-Not for heavy gamers ),The camera is fabulous nothing can compete with the iPhone camera, processed works flawlessly."
182,Anil verma,The iPhone for everyone!,3,"Alright, this review is going to be a little long so hear me out.First things first. Delivery was on time and the seller provided us with a genuine product. So thumbs up 👍  for that.Let me talk a little about the phone 📱. Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one.✅ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry.✅ All-day battery life.✅ A great degree of water & dust resistance.✅ Wireless charging✅ An extra ultra-wide camera✅ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio & Airtel provide this for now)✅ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features.But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical.A high recommendation for this product."
183,ajay,Great Amazon festival buying,4,"Bought this as opening of Great Indian Festival opening for prime members and very surprised to get delivered on same day. This shows the preparation done by Amazon for such sale program. Also want to mention that the price was so great that I didn't saw yet same low price till now. That's the benefit for early buyersAbout product, few things like to mention here with personal experience. No finger print sensor which I believe should be added,  face recognition works very well including in low light and recognition is very fast compare to other brandsBattery life is good, experience the superior quality of photo,  my observation is other brands provide more number of camera but photos are too much processed for more brighter image and loose the original image quality. Other things observed is data speed, although using same network provider and home Wi-Fi, but experience is better in iphone 11"
184,Tushar Bhargava,very down than iphone 12………very far from iphone 12 …. better prefer android than iphone11,5,bgmi heating issue ….. camera very down than iphone ………very far from iphone 12 …. better prefer android than iphone11  or go for iphone 12
185,dr.divya sahu,“Right amount of everything” - True beast,4,"After using it for around 10 months, now I’m giving my review. Really. Now, I can feel why iOS users don’t want to shift to an Android device. I don’t gonna explain unnecessary things. But one thing is sure that Android is nothing in front of iOS due to its open-source nature. Every brand is offering good display, good camera, flagship processor and more. But there is no match with real life performance with iPhone 11. You can still go for 11 instead of 12 or 12 mini as it will worth every penny for a long run. If you’re addicted to customizations or so many false myths then you should stick with Android. iPhone really teaches you a true meaning of a smartphone and what it should be. Hope you guys understand. Final words: it’s like an investment that will show its true value in the long term period."
186,Abhishek,Just right amount of everything! 😉,2,"After seeing so many negative reviews, before buying this beast I was really confuse, whether to buy from Amazon or not. Many people have claimed that Appario Retail Private Ltd. are not delivering good products. But in my case they have done a great job. I received my product today without any damage or clone.Guys believe me they have really improved their delivering services and security.If you are planning to switch from android to iOS then go for it and buy this iPhone 11 from Amazon without any single doubt.😊😊😊"
187,yuvam s.,Reliable battery life,5,"Nothing much needs to be said about an iPhone in general. But I am impressed by the battery life on iphone 11, compared to iPhone XR. I am not a power user / gamer but a moderate business user with about 5 calls a day and about 4 hours of screen usage on email and business Apps. The wide angle camera addition is a useful step up from iphone XR."
188,Soumik,Go for it !,5,Camera is one of the best if not the best. Battery is good enough for 3100mAh. Face ID is very fast. 60hz screen but feels like 90hz due to very smooth optimization of the iOS and apps. PUBG runs very smooth but warms abit. Don't look at the specs and compare with Chinese company phones. Their specs are marketing gimmick. Apple focus on the product quality not product false specs. The LCD is best LCD of all smartphone there is. Size is in direct middle and fits well in pocket. Build quality is top notch. Speakers are extremely good and haptic vibration is also very good. I ordered on 16 and received and expected delivery was 24 but got it in 20. If you’re spending more than 40k on a phone then always buy iPhone. Phone was made in September.
189,KP,iPhone 11,5,I like the phone very much and the battery back up was too good and no complaints regarding myself and apple always prove themselves with the best software by providing to customers and only thing is price was little higher from mid range of other branded phones
190,Imran Ahmed,Apple iphone 11 stops working in a week's time. Quite unusual would like a replacement,4,"This is the 10th day of the iphone 11 purchase, and it has stopped working, it does not switch on  !We would like to return / replace the product but the return window is closed two days ago. Is it a software setup?This iphone was bought from Appario Retail on 21 Nov 22.Would appreciate a feedback and replacementThanks for any help"
191,Bhumika,Dissatisfaction,5,"I took 2 iphone 11 one on last year and second on this year. But, I received earphones and charger for same price which i purchased on last year but didn't receive any accessories for the phone which i purchased this year. Apple is just earning money under the name of not using plastic."
192,Abhishek,Display is worst but its iPhone,2,Display quality is worst.....but its iphone....rest is best
193,Sunny Bhavsar,Battery health drops in 4/5 months in 80%,5,Amazing Photo Quality All over okkBut Battery is very poor…If U are playing BGMI then 4/5 months battery should 80% even if you are using a Normal way
194,Aditya Sharma,"Overall, easily the best value for your money",4,"Easily the best overall mobile phone for nearly two years now, and with good reason. Gifted a purple one to my mother. She was using a Oneplus X for a few years, and she loves the 11. The transition from android was smoother than expected. iOS and iPhone have come a long way from the days of iPhone 6.Pros: that battery, that camera, iOS, Apple care.Cons: are you kidding me?OK, if I had to nitpick, the only annoying thing about iOS is having to use Garage Band to make my own ringtones from songs.Otherwise, it's a pleasure to use this phone each time you pick it up."
195,Aravinth,Good Quality phone from apple with some flaws,4,"I have been using iphone 11 for the last 1 month & these are my findings:1. Battery lasts barely a day, if u use the phone frequently. Using Google maps drains the phone completely within 4 hrs.2. Camera quality is exceptionally well during portrait shots & low light shots & front facing camera is also good.3. Face recognition is blazingly fast but don’t work in angles.4. Display size is good, & fonts/text are clear to read, color representation on screen is good despite not having oled screen5. Charger out of the box is pathetically slow. I always use my ipad charger to charge the iphone 11, and it usually charges from 20% to 90% with the ipad charger within an hour.6. You need to invest on a good quality back case/cover & tampered glass to protect the phone (personally i like the Ringke case)7. Phone heats up sometimes during heavy usage."
196,Lekhrajsingh,Excellent Purchase at an excellent price,4,"Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus, this is a big upgrade. Don't disregard the phone because of its display. Personally, I'm not a Fan of OLED displays and their unnatural colours. But if you love OLED screens, this still isn't a deal breaker.Battery life is great. I am a heavy user and I'm able to squeeze more than 1 day of usage.Ordered during the Amazon Great Indian Festival sale for an excellent price. The phone came with that old packaging, including the charger and earphones but date of import, September 2020.Product was delivered within 13h of placing the order.The negative side is, Amazon doesn't mention the Apple Serial Number or the phone's IMEI Number on the invoice for some weird reason.But the phone's warranty did get registered only the day I turned it on an activated. So I don't think that is an issue."
197,Hariprasad,My first iphone,5,"Despite being a serious android user , after reading and researching a lot about iPhones , finally I decided to bought it , and to my surprise it turns out pretty well , yes the packing of Amazon was good but not up to the marks as this item would be considered costly item and so the packing should have been much better, the delivery time was good and intact I received it before only so full marks on the delivery process. Regarding the phone it is quite a thing to catch the eye with it’s mint green color and super amazing screen and the camera is a beast, the built quality is top notch and you will feel the sturdy product. Yes it’s little difficult to shift from android to iOS but once you get a hang of it then you will start loving it .If you really wanna buy a good phone with statisfaction then you can buy this."
198,Abhishek,Iphone 11 perfect phone,2,Iphone 11 is perfect phone but only  one issue battery and heating
199,Amazon Customer,महंगे शौक 😅,5,"don't need purchase apple product when you can't afford.. because after purchased a iPhone you have purchase every service from apple.. like music download, video download.. etc"
200,Prince,Best iphone ever,4,"Reviewed iPhone 11 after using one month, upgraded from iPhone 6s plus with which i’ve experienced 4 years as secondary phone and well iPhone’s features touched me. Now about 11 its features give so premium feel, but not satisfied for some reason. I don’t know its value for money or not but If 11 is ur primary phone then somewhere u must feel about money matters. Battery is good but not for a whole busy day with all its features. Its terrible thing is, some heating issues while fast charging and heavy using but this could be managed. Rest features  like Camera, face lock , mic, speaker else are good average as this is iphone. Well I’m not a heavy user so enjoying this iphone 11 so much"
201,Nitesh Kumar,Best Buy In 2021,4,"Hi friends,Maine iPhone 11 (128gb) buy kiya tha 25 Mar 21 ko or delivery hui 27 mar 21.Is review ko main part main divide karta hun.01.

202,Sharayu,After 3 months use - Good,5,"Hi,I am using I phone 11 128 last 3 months.Camera - In sunlight photos is excellent but in nigh or in party light photo is not so good.Battery - After 3 months of use battery health came on 99% and with in 1 an hour battery can full charge with original iPhone charger and run for completely 24 hours. Note - I am not a gamer.Style & Performance - As expected from apple product “Excellent”.No heating. No lagging. No hanging in my I phone.Overall worth it and go for it."
203,Jatin K.,Good,4,
204,Abhishek,Happy with the product but not happy with the old phone exchange process,2,"Actually, I ordered the phone (on 2 July) without checking the reviews, as I believed in the Apple quality and Amazon delivery (I am using iPhone since 2012). Later, when I checked the negative comments (around 15% of overall comments), I was bit worried, as all people commented saying they faced heating issues/camera problem/audio and sound issues. However, I received my mobile yesterday (7 July), fortunately everything is good. I will update my review, if I encounter any aforementioned problems in the future.I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I had a lot of problem while exchanging my older phone. The delivery was initially scheduled on 6 July, the delivery guy was uneducated and didn't know the exchange process, I wasted my 4 hours for this process on that day. Finally, on 7 July the new delivery guy came and resolved the process."
205,liyakhat Khan,Worth Buying!,4,"I have used both Android and iOS devices in the past. In fact before purchasing iPhone 11 I had Samsung S10. Working as a Software Engineer I know how important the Data Security is and we all know when it comes to privacy, no brand can beat .Pros:1. Camera Performance is absolutely great! Check out some photos that I have clicked.2. Battery Performance is phenomenal. It easily last for a day with a single charge.3. With the power of Apple’s A13 Bionic chip the performance is exceptionally well.Cons:1. Disappointing factor is Display. Though iPhone 11 has a good liquid retina HD display, considering the price point I think Apple could have provided OLED Super Retina display.2. Bezels are thick and looks old fashionedApart from these I don’t feel there are any concerns."
206,Mohd Tauqeer,For the first time IPhone Buyers,5,"Got it for an amazing deal, Thank you Amazon.This is my first iPhone and it’s damn good. Had seen some reviews saying that the screen is not good, but let me tell you guys that this is the best LCD screen you’ll ever get in an phone. The phone is on the heavy side and needs time to get used to it. And Apple operating system is holding up good and their Face ID is damn fast.I need not comment on the camera quality as it is among the best mobile camera that is available at this price range. I will post some pics clicked by the camera for reference.Talking about the battery life, it is kinda decent will last you easily for a day with more than moderate usage.Would highly recommend this if you are planning to buy your first iPhone."
207,VARSHA,One Of the most incredible iphone Apple has launched after long time,4,I have switched from iPhone 8plus to iPhone 11 and I must say I am really impressed and speechless I can't ask more than this.1 - Best Lcd you won't disappoint  I am myself product designer and pixel pepper display plays a very important role but am really impressed with this display.2 - Size of the phone is perfect not to big not to small and I am guessing loads people may be concerned about that big bezel or notch compare to iPhone 11 pro or 11 pro max after using for a while you don't even realize about that.3 - Everythings looks so good in this phone using the app in this phone is a completely different experience if you come up from old iPhone with big bezels4- Face ID is just one of the best features. Loads people still cry about touch id not there but they are so wrong.Face ID is so fast and so cool I am just loving it.5- Camera Kills all the flagship android phone. What amazing photos you can click with this phone night mode is the rockstar.So Bottomline whoever is thinking to buy this phone just go for it you won't regret
208,Navin,Awesome Phone I have Used So Far,4,"Upgraded from iPhone 6s, I am totally happy with my new iPhone 11. Everything meets perfection on Apple as always, and the Camera is exceptional. Especially when it is low light. I was amazed seeing the result and the best part of the camera I liked is, when you compare the camera taken photo with reality, it looks almost similar. That means no unnecessary color grading or corrections are made on the picture, the result looks very nice and real. You can do color corrections later with the app.Conclusion: If you're a camera person who wants to take more realistic pictures or raw images and cannot afford iPhone 12 now, go for 11. You won't regret, I promise.PS: The images I have attached are at extreme low light condition. In other words, with naked eyes, it was much more darker."
209,Pratyush Kumar Patra,"Amazing Phone, Superb display",4,"Honestly the feel of phone, colors in it is extremely standard. This may not have OLED screen but honestly the quality is top-notch. However if it had OLED, it would be much more battery efficient.This is first time for me to have an iphone as recently I switched from android. I am switching from k20 pro that had OLED and 90 Hz display. Honestly 60 Hz is the only thing on this phone that bugged me else screen is brilliant. Gaming is fire smooth.Camera is too damn good. Extremely detailed to be precise. I have never used the camera of a phone before this much. Night mode pictures are clearly to fall in love with. If you buy quick charger you are then set to use it. Battery is really good but 5W charger is definitely not helping, earphones are also good."

211,Mitesh sharma,Best phone under 50k in 2021,5,It is a good deal if u want a overall good phoneIt has a very good cameraPerformance is also goodWhile playing games it heats a alot so if u r a gamer u can go for a Asus ROG phone.Battery backup is also good. It gives a 1day backup
212,Lakhvir singh,Not the great camera ! Slow charging and useless 5 watt adapter,4,"Phone is perfect in all aspect just few things lacksBattery charging is slow even if I’m charging with Huawei 18 watt chargerAnd 2nd camera I would this could be bcz I’m coming from pixel 3xl and if i have to compare in 10 I would give 10 to pixel even though it didn’t have ultra wide lens and this I would give 6 .Only in 2 thing is got disappointed1 battery charging and backup2 cameraAnd make no mistake it QQUALCOMM quick charge so don’t go for suck Warp .vooc ,Dash , 65 waat and and such kind of charge bcz it only supports PD charge (power delivery) a charger which has out put USB C for example pixel charger and Samsung note 9 and above."
213,amber,Don't fall for Amazon Marketing. Honestly!,4,Writing this review after careful consideration. I am happy with the product it is as expected from Apple.I will review this as per my experience from Amazon(service) and iPhone(product). I will tell write what I liked and what I didn't.Pros1. Professional delivery.2. Product received as described.3. Delivery received before the mentioned/dispatch date.4 Received a made in India device.Cons1. Amazon had prime days where it advertised the product for a price and changed the price the very same day.I couldn't purchase on 6th cause of their payment issues and on 7th they changed the price. Also the delivery dates were changed and had to opt for prime to buy the device. When I bought the prime subsription. The price had raised for the device. hence the discount nullified. As there is a discount on HDFC from Day 1 of 5000/6000.2. The day i had ordered the device the dispatch date changed to 1 week being a prime member in prime days. The second day it was changed to next day delivery and still I did not receive the device. I may not understand the delivery management but felt cheated.3. The prime membership that I was forced (by marketing strategy) to take was of no use to me for the product delivery in future purchases as well that month.Conclusion:If I had not fallen for the marketting of Amazon I would have given it a five star or at least a four star rating.
214,Srikanta Banerjee,Apple never be equal to android baittery backup,5,"Since name is famous people grab it without thinking , but honestly saying android is always best smart multi funtional , if you r taking ios for show shining so then nothing else go for apple in Best Brand for impression .for bussiness uses  i will recomonned only Andrioid Phones vivo oppos samsang mi or any one"
215,Santosh K.,Ok,5,Ok
216,Abhishek,Quality vs Rest of those in markets,2,I had iPhone 6s and it’s been 5+ years now. I decided to go for new one so I will have latest OS and hardware up to date. With market storming with lot of phones and various features I was initially inclined towards non IPhone category but after lot of reviews and seeing quality of those phones my family members have during these years I decided to opt for IPhone 11. Quality is what it matters to me and I do always vote for this.  unless you are a tech freak to try out non IPhones for various features and ready to invest in multiple less costly versions I would recommend IPhone though it costs more for an average middle class person like me. Worth of one time investment.
217,Gaurav,Complete Review,4,"(Writing this review after using one month)1. Starting with built quality, I assure you will get the best premium feel.2. Camera is just awesome,rare and front both.3. If you are shifting from android you will face battery issue. The charge is not that great as compared to android. But with time you will learn to use it properly.4. The face id works butter smooth.5. The dolby audio is something I am great fan of. The sound quality is something heavenly.6. The display enough smooth. It gives tough competition to the 90fps devices.7. If you are thinking to buy it for gaming, I suggest you not to buy this.8. The phone gets heated up after 1 classic match only in Pubg.9. Leaving the gaming aspect, without any doubt you can go for this phone.10. The vibration of this phone is just awesome. It vibrates with sound variation"

219,ankit khanna,The BEST ❤️,5,"I LOVE IT 😌I mean now I can finally understand why everyone is so crazy about iPhones! Even basic apps like WhatsApp and Instagram are so smooth and great to use on this phone unlike my android one. And camera is obviously the BEST!Also the experience really is different on an iPhone and hence I am absolutely in loveeeee!Also worth mentioning - I got this in 49K so this was the best deal for anyone who has not been willing to spend an extra dime on a phone. But now I feel you won’t regret it even if you spend 60-80K on it because it definitely gives you that experience :)About the battery life, it’s not bad but it’s not super great either - however the rest of the things are pretty solid about this phone!"
220,Soumya,Batter heating,5,Phone is heating very soon and high
221,Mohammed Suhail Basha,Love it!!!,5,"I bought the iPhone 11 128gb white and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won’t be running normally or the video quality won’t be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.Pros:BatteryCameraDisplayProcessorCons:The charger provided is only of 5W.Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there’a a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don’t know how).So don’t worry about buying a iPhone here."
222,Abhishek,If You Want Show Off iPhone Logo Then Buy Otherwise Go For Android,2,"bro if you are Android user and you love Android then don't buy iPhone,because in iPhone you will not get any customisation and you will have to to see listen music online you can download it offline in wynk music or any other music appif you can listen online everything then it's ok, YouI can buy this iPhone for better camera quality awesome software experience like fast UI but not best customisable software, because you can't Tweak iPhonebattery is really poor so whatever if you want to buy then buy it - for Showing off iPhone Logootherwise I will say you will get better phone in Android so if you want to buy any Android then go for Android because you will get lots of storage and better camera is also Android camera is really good above 50k Indian rupees"
223,Abhijit Singha,Good Product,5,"excellent performance, especially if you're using it for gaming but extended gaming drains the battery very fast. The camera quality is also very good."
224,Varsha Hunjan,Most value for money iPhone,5,"Amazing iPhone deal for ₹39k.Pros:Impressive camera, particularly in low light.Amazing battery backup- easily lasts more than a day.iPhone's signature memory optimisation.Great sound on stereo speakers.Cons:LCD display pales in front of amoled. Does the job though.Strictly for existing iOS users, as it comes with old iOS bugs & limitations unknown to Android users."
225,surya kuldeep,Best in class,4,"I switched from a realme1 to this phone so obviously i was blown away. The animations are so smooth,phone has premium feel, and its something u feel like u can carry around for the next 5 years.Playing games is on a whole other level on this phone , u can play with The max setting on pubg and 1 game would draw a max of 15-20 percentage. This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal.On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism.Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised.Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D.And Jus for a note..this last year flagship can throw the samsung s20 ultra and run circles around it on the performace level."
226,Shivendra Pratap Singh,Got it for a Better Price,5,Got the product for a better price compared to the offline stores
227,Ghar Sayan,I’m in love with this phone..,5,"First of all there’s no fingerprint sensor in this, which could be an advantage for some and a disadvantage for some people too! One thing you need to note that during this pandemic (COVID-19) you can only use passcode as the only way to unlock your phone (of course while wearing a mask) now to the main topic this phone’s a great machine! This is my first iPhone and hell yeah I’m in love with it (also I cracked a great deal on this). If you wanna by your first iPhone you can consider this. But if you have iPhone X or above model right now and considering to buy This,then This phone’s Bazeels ( sorry don’t know the correct wordings or so) are gonna irritate you a lot! I’m gonna strongly recommend you this phone if your budget is about 50000."

230,Sukhjit Singh,Worth Buying even now in Nov 2021,4,The Performance is best the only concern is Camera quality at night and Selfie at Night - Overall a good package at justified price
231,Hema Rvp,Great value for iPad and MacBook users.,4,"The iPhone 11 is a good package. It is particularly great value for those who have invested in the Apple ecosystem, has bought apps from the App Store I have work flows that sync with iCloud.As a researcher and writer I get access to softwares like Ulysses and Notability on my phone which is great.Besides the phone covers all the essential basic features-a great camera, waterproofing, great battery life, cutting-edge haptic feedback, colour accurate and bright display good for reading indoor or outdoors.I do not have anything to complain about the phone. I think it will be good for another four years at least."

Great camera with superb performance, I have used it for both video capture and editing without any lags or crashes. The negatives(only compared to other iPhones) would be its display and lack of telephoto lens."
235,akash vangani,Great to have an iPhone again,4,I had purchased the iPhone 6s Plus back in 2017. That was one of my best experiences of using a smart phone. So I went ahead and bought this at an affordable price. Really happy to have this phone and writing a review from it 😁
236,Sagar Borade,High price,4,Its a good phone let me give you the pros and cons*CONS-1. Price is to high2. They don't include a charger😠52k for phone 2k for charger3. Not even air pods like before4. I phone 6s gave everything but this 😠Pros-1. Feels so fast2. Best upgrade from 6s3. 4 gigs of ram is enough4. Best camera upgrade from 6s5. Most powerful I phone☺️👍👍Its good if your coming from previous i  phone
237,Aiswarya,Nothing's better than an iPhone,5,"I've used more of Android phones in my life and I was using the Pixel 3a since the last 2 years, but everything fades to the beauty and smoothness of an iPhone. It feels so luxurious. And the camera quality is unbeatable for regular people like us who just like to take pictures to make memories and upload on social media. It is so user-friendly and does not overwhelm you with a million features like in Android phones."
238,Lata,Working well,5,Working absolutely fine
239,Placeholder,Back to iPhone,5,"I was using iPhone se old for a year and was frustrated with its battery performance.I had been moved to android-poco, fantastic battery backup but I was not satisfied with the user interface and smoothness.Bought iPhone11, fantastic performance and battery backup. Smooth and fluid ios.Worth every penny"
240,Abhishek,Best 👍,2,Fantastic
241,Shubhranshu Krishna,Worth the wait!!,5,"Perfect product received, I ordered this phone on 16th October and after seeing videos on YouTube people claiming that they are receiving fake iPhones, I was scared to death. As this is my first iPhone and I have recently shifted from android to iOS, but thank you amazon for delivering the best product possible. The only grievance I had was of the delivery because I received it in a time span of 13 days. Took too long to deliver.. but it was worth the wait!!!! I love my iPhone 😍😍 and the delivery guy was so good that he told me to unbox the phone infront of him so that if there is any defect he could sort it out then and there itself. I couldn’t be more happier!!!!"
242,Neelesh Bihone,Worth-It and Very much Genuine!,4,"Great mobile for the price I bought during Prime sale for 46k(including cashback on hdfc card).Ordered at 12am midnight and received it on next day morning, so delivery was speed enough*Was quite worried about how genuine it'll be since Appario retail Pvt Ltd was the seller. But I have to agree, the product is very much genuine and you can check it easily by giving the serial number in apple website.Being the first time iOS user , I am quite enjoying the product and do not see any flaws till now.However mobile gets heated up a bit while charging (quite common).Greatly satisfied and happy for the purchase!😊"
243,HARISH G,Didn’t Receive cashback of1250.,4,Booked product on 16th October with HDFC credit card but didn’t receive cashback of 1250 and the worst part is when I tried to claim cashback Amazon Executive told me that there was no such offer but luckily I had screenshot of offers campaign so I showed them then they said that cashback was not applicable on iPhones but luckily a acquaintance of mine had ordered iPhone on same day with HDFC credit card and he got cashback also. So have complaint again for the same. Hope I get cashback this time.Coming to iPhone 11The phone is working superb. Checked all the accessories.
244,Gaurav Arora,Great buy....with cost reduction and offers,5,"I was bit worried to order iPhone 11 online but got good experience....as if you see few customers have got worst experience from online buy of iPhonesBattery and display not that great as in 50k you will get better battery and display phoneVs android apps download and installation time is more I observed in iOSOther than this the best face unlock, very convenient user experience, hustle free wireless charging, 6.1 screen great fit in hand. No hang and bug like android phones (I am android user since ages). Overall best package as its iPhone and live up to the expectations. In comparison with new iPhone 12 in terms of cost iPhone 11 is great value for money. works just Amazing."
245,Dr.SR,Battery issue iphone 11,5,I bought this phone on 15/10/2020 .... the Battery  life is pathetic within month the battery health is become 98% and within 2 months 15 days the health became 95% the  the battery Health life  reduction progress is very high ...when I tried with apple I care they saying it’s very normal they have nothing to do  with this ..... simply they saying till 80% it’s normal ...... my question  to apple it’s is 99% also  normal and 80 % also .... is it so .... how can it be .... the average is not matching ..... no matter the the how  much old device is within a month they battery become 90% also they saying it’s normal ... I feel the apple quality have gone down...... they are Clear with what Parameter they following on battery issue ... in apple site they have mentioned 80% 500 cycle ..... if my battery keep on draining I need to charge my phone they obviously  i will meet the 500 cycle ... then they will say the cycle time reached so need to change the battery ....note in this entire usage on my phone i did n play games and the camera usage is very minimal max 50 photo I would have taken
246,Abhishek,Good brand,2,Value for money
247,VishnuN,Superb Phone and delivered on time,4,"Writing this review after one week’s usage - iPhone 11 (White) - 128gb1. What the most I liked about in this iPhone 11 is the Battery life: Battery lasts for 2- two and half days after its fully charged, even if you are using hotspot, wifi, bluetooth, listening music, battery was still 28% and still running smoothly. Which is far more better than Android Phones.2. Prefer buying back cover that covers your camera as well, to avoid scratches in it in future."
248,laxmi,Just a good phone,4,It’s simply a good phone with Apple brand. Good OS optimisation to have a good performance and battery life.I’m slightly disappointed with the Camera as they are advertising. The main camera picture is good n video is also coming better but selfie is really just okay.Simply I can say it’s not a camera phone.
249,SIVA KUMAR BAPANAPALLI,Checks to verify your iphone is new,5,"Some checks to validate that the iphone is brand new:- Once you setup your phone, navigate to Apple check coverage on website and validate that Warranty date is exactly one year from the date you setup your phone.- Check for Battery Health. For a new phone it should be 100%.There is also one more unofficial check related to serial number starting with a particular letter (M,N,F,P). Although Apple claims no such checks exists, many people on Apple forums say that the checks do exist unofficially. If serial number start with ""M"" its a new phone, if its either ""F or N"" its refurbished or used device.The mobile was delivered safely and after all the checks, it's all good for me."
250,AmazoneCustomer 9,A honest review of an android user,5,"Bought it at 59k on prime day . Worth every single penny . If you are thinking about buying it just go ahead and buy it . I was an android user from the very beginning . My first android phone was moto g first gen then came oneplus 3t , asus zenfon 5z , and at last black shark 2 . Finally I decided to switch to ios since i own myself an ipad and MacBook pro . Trust me I regret nothing . The OS is so smooth like a hot knife through a butter . I am happy that i choose ios over android . I dont care much about customisations. All i need is good camera smooth os without any bloat wares . If you are looking for the same go for it"
251,Konark Kashyap,Worth the shot,5,"Its good and trusted and yes it doesn’t include earpods (not talking abt air pods ) nor the adapter only the cable is included ! Brought in the month of November took a risk to buy online coz its alot of money tho ..but the retail shop is 100% trusted , been two months happy with the product and thank you amazon for making it easy for us to buy genuine products  ALSO IF U GOT TO SHOP TO BUY AN IPHONE 11 der will be a alot of price difference due to they include earpods and charger adapter with cable"
252,Abhishek,Awesome as Usual.,2,Apple has always given the best in time.IPhone 11 is one of best phones ever I’ve have seen. Should tell you about this phones battery - You’ll get extra power backed up In terms of battery backup compared to other phones. Definitely the cameras quality is superb in ultra wide angle and portrait modes both front & back. Loved the phone. If you want to go for IPhone then I would recommend IPhone-11.
253,Jyotish,Good Value for Money,5,"My brother has ordered this product, he liked the iPhone very much."
254,Vivek Tewari,Awesomenees and smoothness yes it’s IPhone,5,"If u have points and planning for not changing phone 2to 4 year that iPhone 11 is best optionIt’s my first purchase of iPhone from one plus 5T i am also thinking about its price but after some coupons and amazon icici credits point and cash back, it’s make me happyAbout iphone11Processor is awesome there is no lagCamera and haptic touch is very goodI seen heating problems in some comment I think those people don’t know how to use mobile data optionBattery performance and charging also awesome as campare to XRIt’s display very good and mr/miss siri is equal to alexa relative.So if you are looking for premium phone with best performance go for it and don’t worry about features like 5G.in india 4G services still not good and 5G will take 3 yr to fully operational"
255,vikas thakur,❤️ FAST AND POWERFUL DEVICE ❤️,4,I’m an iPhone user since 2016.So I’m familiar with the power they provide in the phone.I’m using this device for 5 days now.However iPhone 11 is also a beast.In my opinion BATTERY LIFE COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER.Battery: 4/5Speed  : 5/5(will handle every possible mobile tasks)Camera  : 4/5 (Falls a little behind in low light selfies)Display : 3.5/5 (i know it’s LCD but Apple did a great job.You wouldn’t notice it that much)I bought a 12 W charger separately.I wouldn’t recommend 18/20W charger as it’ll ruin your battery faster..12w is good enough.Dont use 5w it’ll take 3-3.5 hour to charge the phone.
256,Vedansh Dwivedi,The iPhone most folks should buy,5,Good hardware at a decent price. The ios 14 is a good addition but no finger print scanner especially in such situations where masks are the new normal its stupid even with sophisticated ir systems for face unlock just dont sit right.Other software and hardware performance  are at par or better than many flagship androids but nothing out of the ordinary.As far as Software features and customizability goes Android is the clear winner.The Apple software seems quite restricted in a way.Overall a decent purchase.Shipping and packaging were excellent by Amazon as always. So no issues there.
257,Abhishek,If you want performance go for it,5,"Well, hardware and OS both are awesome. I’m highly impressed by battery life, I mean the last 1% can go for hours. No body can complain now about battery life, camera is outstanding.It is not only costly because it’s status Symbol, they’re giving actual things."
258,Abhishek,The best product at such reasonable price,2,The best choice I could take in terms of upgrading my iPhone. Used the 6s model for about 5 years and then took this. Got it at such cheap price on Amazon deals. And it’s worth it. Thanks to apple for these best products it gives to customers
259,Prudhvi Raj Nakka ,Nice,5,Good
260,Rahul Pillai,Everything is great except camera quality,5,"Camera is okay but not that great as it was advertised and we can not say it as the world’s best camera in any smartphone because Rear camera is more than good but the selfie camera is not much good. It has a quality which we can get in ₹30,000-40,000 range smartphone. So I will give only 3 out of 5 star for the camera and for remaining other things like processor, performance, battery life etc. “these are just great” and will give 5 out of 5 stars rating!!I’m just unhappy for the camera only!And I think this is the most unbiased review!"
261,Amit B.,Everything is just awsm. Go for it blindly.,4,"Battery - I was bit confused for battery backup. But i m happy, it last all day while using two sim together.Camera - Camera is very very gud but not excellent. If u like natural details pics then its for u but if u like punchy colors and lots of make up then this is not for u. Personally i like it.Performance- Just awsm, if u r android user and u r shifting to ios then u will never be regret. So smooth and secure."
262,DrD19,Apple comeon why you give us 5watt adaptor...,4,"The iPhone11 is a beast phone i mean the phone perfectly work in every field like the phone is very for Gaming,blogging,for pics and all its give u full security,privacy and protection so iPhone11 is alrounder.... And the most impressive things is the battery capacity of 11 is 3110mAh but it give u more battery life than 5000mAh android phones.... and last thing is Y I give 4star not 5 because iPhone11 comes with 5watt adaptor... comeon Apple we buy 68k phone and u give us 5watt adaptor... that it So my viewpoint is u can buy the best I mean iPhone11..."
263,Vishal Prasad,I love this device...❤️❤️❤️❤️,5,"AppleApple says the iPhone 11 will last for an hour longer on its battery than the iPhone XR, which already got tremendous battery life. But the only hard battery life numbers Apple publishes now are fixed tests of single actions, like video and audio playback on a loop. That’s not how anyone really uses a phone, and Apple’s claims of improved battery life over the previous phone aren’t really based on those tests. Instead, the company takes a huge dataset of real-world iPhone usage and runs it against a model of the new phone that accounts for the various processor, chipset, display, and OS power improvements and the larger battery capacity"
264,Abhishek,Loved it,2,It’s just awesome in every aspect got 128gb at a great discount in Great Indian Festival.
265,JIGNESH,Product uis good but amazon cheated in cash back,3,"Product is good as it is apple phone,...but amazon cheated as i was a prime member and payment was done through amazon icici card where offer was 5% confirmed cash back ,but same is still not received"
266,Athul,Absolutely the best phone I’ve used till date,4,"I’ve always been a loyal android user, have used only high end android phones - nexus , Samsung galaxy series,  S9 plus and the like. I was very apprehensive about shifting to iOS as I was told android is much more flexible and I will not be able to adjust to Apple. My phone got delivered before time, I charged it and started using it by afternoon. Took a couple of hours for data transfer and by evening I was completely in love with this phone. Was amazed by the interface and no nonsense whatsoever kind of vibe from this phone. I also got it at a very reasonable price from amazon shopping festival. Thank you Amazon and Apple !"
267,Amazon Customer,Extract full worth of iOS and the high-end hardware experience,4,"The screen size does full justice for harnessing the iOS experience. Face ID is awesomely quick. Speaker sound is comparable to some high end external speakers we use with PCs. With headphones, it is the usual great quality of an Apple device. Personally I would have preferred a slightly smaller screen size like iPhone 12 in this price for a more easily portable device for carrying around."
268,Aamir khan,Well developed device,4,"After upgrading from iPhone 6 it feels quite good to use a flagship model like this. Camera quality is awesome, battery backup is way better compared to the previous models of iPhone, A13 Bionic chip is really powerful, if you’re a gamer you must own this device, PUBG,Asphalt etc runs smoothly in this device but the device heats up while playing games. We’ll go for the pro or pro max model if you wish to have a telephoto lens along with OLED display along with silver coating which feels premium, else you may go for this . I really welcome android users to have this device , it’s literally a beast in all aspects"
269,pritam,Received defective item need replacement,5,Defective item received
270,Abhishek,The perfect phone does not ex......,2,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 The phone is amazing.First of all, the battery backup is amazing and it can easily get you through a day of work very easily, i am a moderate user and with a screen time of around 5 to 6 hrs it lasts the whole day without any problems.Second, the camera is awesome , pictures come out crisp and clear whatever be the time, night mode works like a gem, the balance it creates between the background and the subject is accurate . It does not over expose anything.Next is the user experience, after coming from an android device i must say the user experience is very very good. Everything is smooth and crisp without any hiccups.It is a perfect marriage of software and hardware taking you to a great experience."
271,Narendra N.,Good Phone,4,After using iphone 11 for more than 1 month. It feel really nice. Still feel iphones are overpriced.
272,subramanyam,Iphone 11😍,5,Bought this mobile in great Indian festival for 46k with all.possiblr discounts... I have seen few reviews and also youtubers videos that its a defective product or clone mobile... But I received genuine product with full warranty... E comm giant like amzon will not do fraud maybe some of there employees or delivery boys can do this type of things... Will this is my honest review ...I am not paid to review this nor I received anycashback offer for this review its just that I have seen so many reviews and videos so thought of sharing this...
273,Ramesh Khatwani,Perfect  iPhone with best camera  and performance,4,"Brought this iPhone on Amazon for 54999rs on 18th October 2020. Good price for the 128GB variant. Using it for a week, really awesome mobile, performance,  camera all are perfect. Took this mobile to the apple store and verified  it's a apple product. It came with headphones  and charger  within the box.Really good for this price. I'm really happy.Guys always go for the Amazon fulfilled sellers. Saw lots for negative  reviews on social media  for both amazon and flipkart selling fake iPhones. All are not true. If you have any doubts go and check you device with apple store. See my uploaded picture what's comes in the box. , it will help."
274,Pyare DebBarma,The Intelligent Phone!!!!!😘,5,"What to say, it “The Iphone” best in class top notch.Its one month today exactly I have been using this I would like to rate this product like1- camera 5/52- battery 5/53- screen 4/54- sound 5/5These 5 points i feel are the most imp points in order to rate any phone out there. I just love using it this is my 3 rd iphone in 6 years and yet it didn’t disappoint me. If you want to buy a phone inside 55k this is the perfect fit for you. Privacy is the best in class not like other they still and sell you data. Its the best!!!!!!😍"
275,Ajay Kumar.Prakerla,"literally, the best purchase from amazon!",4,"best phone and amazon service .. camera quality is excellent.. and people complaining about phone heat, it is because the charger is of 20v and that is why but it doesnt cause any damage or have any effect on phone. The heating starts normalising after 80% of charge. JUST GO FOR IT.. its is such a good deal. TRUST ME ."
276,Abhishek,Important tacts to avoid frauds and small review on the product,2,"At first I was very afraid of ordering an Iphone from Amazon as many have very bad reviews like “given used phone”,”defective item”,etc. Still took thr risk to order it from this seller. FORTUNATELY I WAS LUCKY TO GET A GOOD PIECE WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.An important note which i always follow is that whenever u get a package from amazon delivery boy -DO CHECK AND OPEN IT INFRONT OF HIM”many a times i have seen tweets that even u have the video of unpackaging they refused to take the order if some things are not right.Now regarding my views on Iphone 11 in a single word -“AWESOME”....Liked the elegant design and top notch features ."
277,Manjunath,Good product and average price,5,its enough for normal user good iphone but not a features as per price in this segment
278,Nikita,One hell of a phone!,4,"I switched from Android to iOS for the first time and it has been keeping me amazed! Smooth touch, responsive apps, excellent UI, mind blowing camera, I can now understand why iPhone users say something is different in it! Absolutely unbelievable experience! Cherry on top is security, use bank and payments app without any hassles! Loved it! Two drawbacks are 1) No headphone and charger (you have to shell more money 😭) 2) No fingerprint scanner and using faceid in COVID is a PIA."
279,Siddarth A,The Best Value IPhone from APPLE!!!!!,5,It’s a value added phone for the money. If you are someone is gonna buy an iPhone for the first time. You can surely go for iPhone 11. It has the same camera (except for the telephoto lens) of the pro models. The iOS optimization would give you good battery life. Apple also promises updates for the next 5 years. I have been using this phone for 1 year now and the performance is exactly the same like how I bought the first day. Everything is so amazing about this phone that you won’t have to spend money to buy the pro models. Surely go for the iPhone 11 you won’t regret it.
280,Abhijeet Sinha,Good Buy.. But without charger or speaker after such high prize..!,4,Good Buy.. But without charger or speaker after such high prize..!

282,Abhishek,Nice perchesing,2,Better
283,Ankit,Iphone 11 black,5,Moved from XS to 11… speed is awesome as always.. LCD display is good and honestly in real life use nobody can spot the difference in LCD and OLED… happy with the purchase.
284,Kalbe Abbas,Love for iPhone 💫,5,👍🏻
285,da_cool_guy,IPhone 11 🔥,5,"This is my first time using iPhonePros1. Camera is too much better than most of the smartphones with 48, 64 and 108 mp camera2. Face ID works all the time even with lowest brightness of phone in full dark room3. Surround Sound is excellent, it was soo pleasing4. Battery backup is better it  lasts almost a day on average using(No games)Cons1. Charging speed is too low, it takes about 3hrs to charge from 0 to 1002.Display could have been slightly better, but still it's a better one3. Heats up slightly on heavy usageDelivered on time By Amazon, Happy with product and Amazon service as well."
286,Amazon Customer,My First Apple Product!,5,"After lot of comparison among iphone 11, samsung s20 and one plus 8 pro (As all three in some or other offer are available for price just under 60000Rs), I went ahead with iphone 11.It’s my first flagship phone and I am totally loving it. It’s camera capabilities are well known and I need not comment, can be used to make movies too!!. My average screen time is 7 hours, and a full charge a day is sufficient for me. 3 hours is required for a full charge and one can purchase 12W or 18W charger to decrease the time to charge. Face recognition works well even in dark conditions and is fast but it don’t work with a mask."
287,Ruby Taurus,Long battery life,4,Got this during Great Indian Sale for 48k such a steal deal. Arrived in perfect condition with all accessories included. Facial recognition is no match with any android one. Though a bit annoying that finger print unlock is not available as we wear mask these days. Device performance is smooth. Battery life is wonderful. Camera is good not the best. Was skeptical about the Lcd display as my previous phone was Led but after few days could not feel the difference. The speaker is awesome had to say.
288,Abhishek,"Yes, it’s a Good iPhone!",2,"The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn’t up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung’s A 30’s which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers..Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can’t help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years.Sound & Call Quality also NetworkSound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent!Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection.Camera:The Live Photo’s with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn’t take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :PI would’ve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!"
289,Amazon customer ,Awesome Deal,5,"This is my first iPhone, and I was Android user from more than 10 year, now I tried iPhone and feeling awesomebelow are my finding.1.  Camera quality is awesome,2.  Screen size is awesome fit in palm3.  From Back side purple color is looks solid, along with apple logo.4.  Came along with charger and EarPods5.  Face detection is quite fast.6. Don't have finger Print reader but i dont feel much presence as face detection is awesome and very fast.7. Battery is quite good but charging is slow.8. it comes with Volte so that is good where we have network issue in India."
290,sunmeet,Best iPhone for the money,5,"got it 47k during the deal. excellent price for 2019 iPhone, considering 12 hasn't released yet. gives you 90% of all 11 Pro features at 40% of the price. Phenomenal value.Most reviews would have covered everything but i will mention my favorites--large screen-dual camera, ultra wide is amazing-face id-water resistance-free Apple TV+ for 1 year-battery life is highest in this price range-portrait mode is perfect and unmatched-iOS is smooth as ever, and simple to use.some cons could be--newer iphone 11 orders will not have charger and earphones-phone is a bit heavy if you are coming from smaller phones like SE, 7, 8, etc."
291,Akshay,Go for it !,4,Amazon did its work pretty wellThe product was delivered one day priorI was quite happyComing to the phoneI was an android user who currently shifted to iPhone 11 and IM TOTALLY LOVING ITIt's a whole new world for meThe camera is top notchFace id recognition is above expectationsEverything is soo goodThe only con of iPhone 11 is the battery lifeIt takes more than 2 hours to completely charge to 100%  and it exhausts quickly as wellIf this aspect of iphone 11 is taken care of by the apple store then there is no one that can beat iphone !!
292,Prithvi Nayak,Much better than my expectation,5,"I’m writing this after one month of using it.Battery 5/5 - so far the best I have seen on a phone both android or iosCamera: 4.5/5 - honestly this is the best camera out of all iPhone till 11 (excluding the pro models). One thing which I was expecting was to control shutter speed atleast in the night mode settings it only gives me pre defined options.Display: 4/5 even though you wont be able to see individual pixels, still would have been a tad better it the pixel density was little more atleast better than xrPerformance: 5/5 No doubt every iphone release breaks the previous record"
293,A R Sahu,Still best in 2021,4,"My sister uses 12 and I tell you there's no difference other than 12 hold better in hand. I still like 11 over 12 or 13, Apple now sells it for 49999 after 13 launch, I bought it before launch at 55999. Wait for amazon price drop and this phone is a steal in 2021 or 2022, iphone performance and camera are unmatched."
294,Abhishek,Superb Camera and Sound,2,"Superb mobile, most awesome thing i felt yet is Camera and Sound. Dont go to negative review… my iphone is delivered by appario seller and it is genuine product and working perfectly."
295,sumanth sharma,My kinda IPhone 📱,5,Best IPhone ever. Great value for the money. Great build quality & Camera Quality is top notch as usual. With the latest iOS version the usage of the phone becomes even better. I don’t think I will ever go back to Android 😉
296,Anand Sivadas,Waste of money,4,Logo is good.But u should provide a power adapter as well
297,Diksha Arya,Great product and great service go for it,4,"Bought it during the great Indian sell for 48k delivery was quick the box was a little discoloured otherwise everything was fine and sealed ..its my first time moving to iOS Face I’d is quick ,camera quality is top notch ,battery lasts for a whole day for heavy user also the only con is you must have a laptop if you are buying iOS devices cannot update the software  on mobile WiFi or mobile data otherwise everything is in top of the line haven’t face any issues yet"
298,kundan,Excellent 👌🏻,5,Was using android for years… but once I bought iphone… and wow… i am surprised… no hang or lag issue at all… which you notice in any other brand while using excessively.
299,Asif Ali,A must if you are upgrading from previous gen,2,"Was hardcore into android with rooting and all , moved to iPhone three years ago with iPhone 7 , and I no longer see spec sheets cause the performance is always at par with Apple  , with frequent updates you can literally use it for years , switched to iPhone 11 and trust me the screen is really good , I know it’s only HD screen but trust me it won’t make drastic difference, besides lcd screens have better life than amoled as per me , amoled screens tend to have burn in issues over the time , with latest processor and great camera this is definitely great phone , plus it has dual sim (e-sim) it has come very handy to me during foreign trips as most radio frequencies are supported by Apple"

Well I’m not a heavy user so enjoying this iphone 11 so much. And his 3100mh something battery capacity is very low for gamers."

305,Ravi Karthik,Not worthy for the price  as accesories been not provided):,4,There is no finger print reader for iphone 11 and no adapter and ear phones given not worthy for price  and those must be given and what are the measures taking in india after the fine on iphone was imposed in brazil ???
306,Abhishek,"Perfect product ,Amazing delivery.",2,The product was delivered before the said the date which was wonderful as i was super excited . I have ready many bad reviews for the product and was afraid of the same but got it without any defects and its working as expected . I got my 128 gb at a good price on the big billion day.There was no hassle in the exchange as i have opted for it by giving my old iphone 7 for this one and the executive was professional where my phone had a scratch on the body but they have taken it as the screen was clear and perfect.
307,Mohit,Loving it!,5,"I have been an iPhone user 8 years now. The battery backup is very much improved in iPhone 11. Performance is great.Highlighting an issue which happened for me but was resolved. May help others as well.After I started the new phone, in the initial steps I chose to set it up using my old device 6s.Post that the phone was super heated from a short usage, battery was getting drained and voice memos failed to respond after launch.Apple customer care helped a lot and eventually tried the option to reset the iPhone 11 and set it up from scratch as raw. Restored the data from iCloud later.Strange, but the phone now works like a charm as I mentioned in the start.Evaluate your usage and budget to make the right choice."
308,Aishwarya Jeyachandran,Good phone,4,We need fingerlock also but this is not available in this phone
309,Praveen,Amazing Service!,4,Its obvious how amazing this product is otherwise you wouldn't be here reading this review. I would like to shed some light on how amazing Amazon is. I got the product 24 hours in advance in perfect condition during heavy monsoon season. Amazon really surprised me and did an amazing job! No issues with the product. Kindly read all return and refund policies before ordering. Amazon is really transparent and all the information you need is in this page. So read intently and hopefully you won't have any further questions. Just add to cart and don't think too much!
310,Nagesh Muddaveerappa,Iphone - smooth as silk but screen is a let down,4,"The phone is super quick, is intuitive to use, has good cameras and the battery easily lasts a day.The only grouse I have is the screen. While many may not have felt it, I surely felt shortchanged. I switched from a Samsung S10e to iphone 11. The s10e had a beautiful Oled screen, some notches above this one. Just couldn’t digest a mediocre screen on a phone that costs more than 60k.I was also able to compare the camera with that of the S10e, and the results were mixed. It took better selfie and portrait pics, but fell little short in rear camera pics. No doubt, it has a very good camera system but definitely doesn’t live up to the hype of ‘the best camera ever on a smartphone’."
311,Afjal mansuri,Very good product.,4,"The reason why I am writing this review is some people received fraud product. I brought this too at Amazon's great Indian sale and got the right one. Its authentic and I got it checked online by just providing my ime number to apple. Delivery was on time. I am not blaming other people for the fraud on them, they maybe right but right now I am satisfied with the product. Speaking about battery life you should buy a 18watt fast charger either through apple store online or through third party companies such as anker. Slightly less battery backup can be compromised by fast charging."
312,Abhishek,Just excellent.,2,The product feels very nice to hold and has really a catchy feel in hands. The only thing that was missing was the fingerprint sensor. Except that everything is fine.
313,Rajeev,The best phone to get - A long term review of IPhone 11 64GB,3,"Here’s my long term review on IPhone 11 64GB. I had ordered this phone around 7months back and this has been my daily driver since then. To give you a perspective I am using the dual sim in here reliance Jio as esim and Vodafone idea as physical sim. Both works fine and network connectivity is great.WiFi reception is Average I would say.Call quality is awesome one can hear clean and crispThe speaker is Loud and the music plays great I love itThe display is good but not great like my Old Note 9, but still colour reproduction is accurateBattery back up is good and it typically lasts a whole day.The phone is slippery so I use a back case.Nothing more to say about i0S and it’s updates they are great"
314,Nagur Basha Shaik,Pretty decent iPhone at a good price,4,"Bought it for about 45k. Pretty happy with it's performance. A little on the heavy side though, and face scan is not as efficient as I anticipated.Rest all perfect.Amazon service was pretty good too"
315,Hemant,Excellent !! Do not hesitate to buy!,4,"I am writing this review because before deciding to buy one for myself, I was going through the reviews and there were a quite a few of them mentioning that people should avoid buying an iPhone from Amazon.However, since I had a gift coupon from Amazon and Prime sale was offering me a superb deal, I decided to go for it.I got the hone delivered the very next day. Packaging was good, however, expected a cardboard packaging, which was not there. Checked and verified my phone. It was a new one. No heating issue. Everything is working fine.The phone itself is great, superb camera, looks good, excellent battery life. Truly worth the price especially if you are switching from Android."
316,Roshan,I love this iPhone 11 beautiful quality thanks you so much Amazon,4,Super phone
317,Shivam,Genuine product and a good deal by amazon,5,"I purchased iPhone 11 with wireless AirPod 2nd generation... i got both of this in 59k. Below i have listed pros n consPros: Both iphone and Airpods are genuine. To get confirmation install apple support app and get connect with apple. Have a call and check everythingCons1. Packaging is pathetic, i cant believe that a giant organisation like amazon can sends a valuable product just in a simple plastic bag without taking any precautions. This is very serious matters, amazon shouldn’t repeat this."
318,Abhishek,"Very nice, genuine product, thank you",2,"No fingerprint reader in this phone, battery life is so good, nice camera quality, smooth phone"
319,Ayush Apoorva,"Another Beauty From Apple, Such a Great Experience.",5,"First of all, I was so scared and confused to buy from Amazon after reading all negative reviews but still, I took a chance and I’m so glad that I made the right choice. I was upgraded from iPhone 7 and it was a great experience with all the latest specs and great battery performance. I have been using it for almost 2 months. There is nothing to question about quality or any kind of issue. I love this green colour as I wanted to go for some different color. Thanks to Amazon and Seller for providing the original product with great condition."
320,Balsanchi sangma,Fully satisfied with my first iphone 😊,4,Fully satisfied with the phone😊😊
321,Rahul kumar,Excellent,4,Iphone naam hi kafi hai..
322,Himanshu jain,Unlocking issue when wearing mack,4,Does what it says.IPhone 8 plus was better as atleast I could unlock it with fingerprint.You can’t unlock this phone while wearing mask.Buy an apple watch if you want to.
323,Pawan kumar,85/100,4,"I’ll be frank here.If you are considering the phone just for camera, go for Oneplus8 pro. It has a better camera.If you are looking for a overall satisfying experience, above average camera and Apple ecosystem, get this one.The price is on higher side and you can get almost similar experience with OP8Pro.Having said that, the phone is not bad.It has perfect size(OP8Pro is large), Performs good, Face ID is amazing, battery is good, fluid UI, no lags but the micro levels of tweaking you get in android are missing.Hope this helps."
324,Abhishek,Nice product,2,Pros :Touch is really smoothBattery backup is automatically adjusted according to your sleep cycles .Alarm cycles are also tracked and the phone automatically sleeps as you sleep and battery does not drain even a single % while you are sleeping.IOS14 update came within 2 daysSwitching between apps is very smooth and feels classy. I switched from anroid to I phone and i love the way the phone works starting from switching between apps and smoothness of operations.Camera is really good. Slow motion videos and normal pictures have depth. Camera is at par with one plus 68mp camera.Various apps such as I tune U provide you free resource of Knowledge. You can do online courses for free on I tune U app.ConsBattery takes 3 hours to charge fully from 0-100% .Hotspot bug is there . It keeps disconnecting every 3 hours or so. You have to again switch it on.Charger provided is 5W charger and hence takes time . Although apple provides charging with 18W charger but I would recommend to use that only if its an emergency or else you will lose out on battery life.Overall a nice product to buy.
325,Aman Patel,Good mobile,5,Good mobile and the camera quality is good
326,Kesava Murthy,Defective battery,4,Battery is defectiveAfter charging 100per the battery percentage drops into zero(0)From nowdays I will never trust Amazon .....It's not a single penny it's about 48kFor common person it's huge amountAnd no one will not accept such defective items.Meanwhile I tried to return but AmazonDirectly said talk to appleIs that fair ?@AMAZONI can say loudly that Flipkart is far better than Amazon I know theirs item price is high but atleast they care after being delivered
327,Dr syed,Product is very good,5,Product is very good but my iphone 11 imei is not mach exchange show massage this imei doesn't mach iphone 11
328,"Beautiful0Destruction , India",One of best,4,One of the best among all apple phones even better than 12 and 13
329,Raguram,Ticks everything that you’d expect a great phone to do.,5,"Battery life is pretty good. I start my day at around 8 in the morning with 100% charging and end my day at around 10pm in night with around 15-20% battery with a screen time of 5-6 hours. Camera is top notch especially the video quality. 4k videos at 30fps is amazing. Though the phone has only 60hz refresh rate, it is smooth enough. As always, the iOS is pretty perfectly optimised. It’s a very good buy overall."
330,Abhishek,Consider this phone for status symbol.,2,"Phone camera is super cool, especially night mode.Battery backup is average and have to charge everyday.Edit (Wed, Aug 2022) Apple Service Centre is very pathetic. I had my phone water damaged and took it to service centre for repair. The reply I got: Sir we don't repair water damaged phone but we could give you another refurbished phone at almost same price. How on earth they couldn't repair my phone. Did the manufacture it on Mars?"
331,Ratan Suthar,The apple of my eye!,5,"I used to hate Apple as I was an android user, a hardcore one intact. I had a Oneplus 3T. I used to think specs are the ultimate factor in a phone. I was mistaken. Though this phone has an LCD display below 1080p, it is gorgeous. You won’t notice and flaws or pixels. Apple deserves credit for this.Coming to the camera quality, OMG! The best smartphone camera, period. Video is buttery smooth! The battery life is also amazing.I’m not giving a 5 star just for the camera or the screen or for its amazing battery life.The game changer for me is iOS! Switching from android to iOS was hassle free and the operating system keeps on surprising me. It’s an experience and will leave you with a smile on your face. Delight, surprise, love and connection. That’s what Apple makes you feel."
332,Placeholder,Fabulous phone,5,"Great phone with a very good camera and FaceId feature. The phone does not have a finger print reader. It was very easy to transfer information from my old phone. Just switch on the new phone, connect it to wifi, plug both the old and new phone to power and place them snear each other. Then start the transfer process. in approx. 30 minutes its all done. All the apps, photos, songs etc. get transferred directly for the old device to the new device. No need for backup and restore. Then transfer the SIM from your old phone to the new phone and you are all set. Seamless!!!"
333,Arun verma,Mobile is good but 5g should also be compatible with this,4,Netwrok issue is there.. amazon app always laggs dont know why .. battery backup is not consistent .. sometime give fantastic backip sometime very very bad.. with similar kinda usage….. now I doubt there may be something wrong with online product.. batterly health dropped drastically…. Bad experience
334,Rishabh Kumar,Amazing Powerful and Durable Gadget.,5,"iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !"
335,Ashish Srivastav,Battery life is very less,5,overall ok
336,Abhishek,More than a Delight in diwali,2,I am more than delighted .. apple has its own charm although I have used some apple devices like iPad and Mac this is my first iPhone and ya getting into the ecosystem I am surprised to know why apple turn up everyone’s head .. thank you apple to make our life a bit easier through technology although u take heavy bucks for everything.. 😂😂 but anyway this is a review and except from price everything is just more than a charm
337,Rajesh,Disappointed with amazon,4,"Phone is great but I am really disappointed by amazon service. It was applicable for bonus 1 offer and I was suppose to get cashback of 1250 and an executive said expect it by wednesday but when it dint credit on chking with amazon executive again they said its not applicable!There was no stars or mentioned in FAQs that iphone is not applicable for bonus.Felt like wrong advertisement, cheated and really disappointed by amazon offers and services. Been amazon customer for years and this experience is really very disappointing. Feels like lost the trust in amazon :( Wrong advt and incorrect offers was just never expected from amazon!"
338,Shikhar Garg,iPhone 11- my thoughts after 6months,4,"+Excellent snappy phone if you don’t look pixels through microscope as it’s not an OLEd panel+ Good full day battery+ excellent water and splash resistance coming handy during now in COVID+ good main camera, low light is good as well, don’t use much of wise angle-slow charge-poor selfie camera- wide phone unfriendly gripping- slippery , use case- back glass smudge game- No hi res video support on YouTube- pricyIf an iOS sticker get this device if not get One plus 8pro with lesser amount"
339,Shriraj,Battery doesn’t deserve a 5W charger. Awful !!!,5,The 5W charger is really a pain....don’t know why Apple is providing it.It’s’ staking more than 3.5 hrs to charge the iPhone full and the adapter is getting extremely heated after 30 mins or so.YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO BUY AN 18W C CHARGER PLUS C CABLE if u want to get rid of this battery issue and be ready to shed an extra 5k.Rest I found an issue with the MEASURE app from the utilities section which makes the iPhone getting heated instantly within minutes of use.Anyone having the same issues ??suggestions are most welcome.

342,Abhishek,Best upgrade from 6s,2,"Upgraded from 6s to iPhone 11. Best upgrade ever!! Love the phone. Speed, clarity, screen display, battery life and camera all are really good as compared to my old phone and have no complaints at the end of a month use."
343,Ujjwal Anand,Superb,5,Superb
344,Dead-Snipper,Best purchase,4,I bought this phone in October 2020 for around 45k during a sale. The phone is still in its best phase and I didn’t even realise it’s been such a long time. Love it!
345,Nikhil,Adapter,5,I like this phone buy with this they should give adapter.
346,abhijeet,The phone that I needed,5,"After few months of waiting and research about which phone would suit me the best, I bought this in 2020.I think there isn’t a single phone that would work for everyone, they all have different expectations and needs. I was looking for a phone that’s water resistant, takes really good videos, has powerful processing, has better than average battery life, has magnetic sensor for better navigation and provides good user experience while using the phone. Stereo speakers was an add-on. Basically, this phone has fulfilled all my expectations."
347,MANJEET SINGH,Good,4,Heating problem for that I’m little disappointed otherwise all ok
348,Abhishek,iPhone 11: Best Buy for 2020,2,"Switching from iPhone 6s, iPhone 11 was such a good option. As there were battery issues with iPhone 6s but there are none with this one, absolutely great battery life. Also, the camera quality is way too enhanced... it’s damn awesome ! Plus, not to forget about the face unlock that precisely detects your face even when there’s less light. Talking about delivery and packaging, I received the package in proper conditions from amazon & there were no damages on the outside or inside of the package i.e. I received my phone as expected ! Absolutely happpyyy with this purchase, Thanks Amazon."
349,Altamash,Pubg Gamer's review😁,5,"There is no android phone in the market which could compete this beast. Undoubtedly best for Pubg if you taking this for game or youtubing go for it......if not i think you should switch to oneplus varient.....best thing about this phone is its privacy and gaming screen recorder its just unbelievable.....only cons (charging process is very slowwwwwww it takes 3hrs for 5w charger, 2hrs for 12w charger and 1.5hrs for 18w charger) NO FAST CHARGING the only reason for 4 star😉😉😉"
350,Saswat,Good product..,5,Good product.. Using for 2 months .. No issues until now...
351,Ritima,Original phone received and working fine.,4,"A very honest review, first of all I would like to thank amazon to delivered the genuine product. I have received the original apple product along with all its accessories like adapter, data cable and handsfree in its box. The best part is the phone is made in India. Its being 2-3 months and phone is working fine as of date. Also I have checked on the apple site weather the phone is original or not and yes I found it original. Thank you so much Amazon for fulfilling your commitment."
352,Amazon Customer,Iphone vs Android experience,4,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)"
353,Lucifer Morningstar ,Full set of charger should supply .,5,Charger should supply .
354,Abhishek,Amazing Device!,2,"To start off i must say i was really scared ordering after seeing such negative reviews. But to my delight all is well! The phone is original and has a valid serial number. I have upgraded from iphone 8 plus to iphone 11. I feel there is immense battery improvement as that was a major issue with 8 plus.It has a bigger screen than 8 plus but has a small overall body! So, i you prefer bigger phones you may go for 11 Pro Max. But otherwise at this price it is amazing and overall i am happy to have upgraded from 8 Plus!"
355,Ashok kumar,A great offering if u are looking for ios,4,Design -7/10Display-7/10 if u are comming from a lcd display like myself u would love this displayCamera -8.5/10 great colours the only thing i have to do is point and shoot everything else is done by the software -greatly impressedPerformance- 9/10 using this phone for 2 weeks no lag what so everOver all a great phone from apple even the best deal on any iphone at the moment the phone gives immence value for money
356,Sumit Kumar Tiwary,Great.Value for money.,5,"The delivery was fast it reached in 1 day. The phone as you know always the iPhone are best at camera,performance,sound and display.As it is a LCD panel I never noticed it is a cheaper panel,when using it feels it a OLED panel because apple has made it to such level it never feels inferior.If you are so much concerned about the display and notice a point-point of display then you should choose the OLED panel iPhones(e.g 12’s)The A13 Bionic is Beast.It doesn’t need to be described.The Camera,oh what should I tell it has the greatest camera quality on a smartphone."

359,Rajmin Maheriya,"The end to your endless search for fully loaded, advanced and unbeatable phone now in the market!",5,"Awesome camera features, just like professionals! So many features, that I strongly suggest to check out tips and tricks video on you tube... so that you don't miss out any of the hidden features! They say that, battery is improved. But I don't see, much change. May be because of my use. Otherwise ok. And about face recognition.... I suggest you record your face picture in all light conditions to your phone camera. Because, if you record your face in bright daylight, the phone finds it difficult to recognise you in low light conditions. Rest All fantastic! Even delivery was lightening fast and well secured! The packet was opened in front of me (after confirming my identity!) and I was asked to check the contents before delivery. You will enjoy carrying iPhone 11. Feel proud & Go for it!👍"
360,Abhishek,awesome I Phone,2,"You will fall in love with this phone ...fast , Sturdy ,Stylish ,elegant all at onceCamera is awesomeBattery life is good too ,it stays for more than a dayOnly cons are following:Purple colour is good but should have been 1 or 2 shades darkerCharger included is slow 5w charger  and charges very slow 2.5 hours for full cahrge  , you will have to buy separate fast charger"

365,rajesh,amazing phone brand new,5,ordered this product on amazon big billion day sale. the product packaging was very good and the product is 100 percent genuine as one can see on apple id when the product got registered and got full 1 year warranty. the phone is very fst and the software experience is very fluid. got this phoneat rs 44k. the best deal i can get on iphone. one looking to purchase iphone can surely put money on this. tough at this price factor one can get android with much more features. but if u want a unique experience then apple is the way to go
366,Abhishek,Good and genuine product by Amazon,2,"Great discount purchased during offer. Earphone and charger included along with data cable. Secure delivery. Packaging was not good but iPhone cover itself is rock hard which can protect the inside item very well. Camera quality is awesome, Night mode even better, Great look, mine is purple, suits both gender. Super speed function, face unlock very sensitive, front camera very good. Only 1 physical sim can be supported, and another e-sim can be installed if required. Battery life not as expected, I used to charge atleast once every day. No screen guard included. Many free android apps are not free in ios."
367,paresh,iPhone 11 is a flagship & more!,4,"Spectacular!Positive:-1.Battery- 7:30-8 hrs screen time which is great easily lasting a day & more.12 watt charger(bought separately) charges to 70% in 1 hour,so good.2.iOS.iOs.iOS.if u hav an iPad/Mac life will be easier with an iPhone.3.Camera:- good.Honestly I expected more.Portrait mode is great.Nightscape is yet to be tested.Best video camera.4.Performance:-A13 Bionic chipset.4gb ram. Enuf said.throw anything-iPhone 11 will do it with ease.5.Future updatesNegatives:-1.Bulky & display:The phone really feels heavy & with the lcd notch panel,it is highly unsuitable for binge watching.The wired EarPods is odd & doesn’t help either."
368,JATIN GOSWAMI,Amazing phone . Loved it,5,I was using iphone 7 for 3.5 years and it was finally time to upgrade.Looking at price of iphone 12 . It was not possible to buy such an expensive phone.Thanks to great indian festival by amazon got this beauty at 45k.Very delighted by asthetics and performance.Although battery life is still an issue I get 1 n half day with regular usage. I doubt over the years it will degrade.Camera is superb. Screen is better than my previous phone so works for me.If you want iphone go for this.Otherwise s20plus is good alterantives
369,Gurvinder S.,Suhail Kareem,5,iPhones are always the best. But it depends on your usage when it comes to battery backup. iPhone 11 is the best ever phone I have used till date. It has the best battery of 3110 and gives the user a full day usage with enabling mobile data on all the day.  You can still buy the iPhone 11 even after the launch of iPhone 12 when you need a good battery backup.
370,Pratyusha,Go for it blindly,5,I was very much worried when I ordered this phone from Amazon sale cuz of so many negative reviews  n grabbed it in 44k around. When I unboxed it and check warranty along with every possible detail I found it to be a superb phone at a jaw dropping price. My phone has no heating issue or camera issue or whatever issue these guys have mentioned in reviews. All over a great deal. Just go for it blindly as it’s still cheaper than what u get in offline store. Specifications u guys r already aware of.
371,Yazir Hassan,Battery backup,5,"Being a middle class family I bought iPhone 11 with facing a lot of problems, waiting for almost 2 years by doing part time jobs But definitely it’s worth of money , camera is damn sooo good and performance is really really smooth and it’s battery performance is quite good ..Literally I don’t have words to explain how beautiful it looks and for its performance , it’s just perfect it’s worth of money , THANK YOU SO MUCH AMAZON FOR AMAZING SALE AND GIVING ME OPPURTUNITY TO BUY MY DREAM IPHONE IN SUCH A HUGE DISCOUNT ."

I checked the imei with bill if it matches.2. Serial number on apple site to see if it was activated earlier.My phone passed both. Next charge and see if any heating issues come. Mine didn’t.Really happy with the purchase. Just wish delivery could be faster.I have earlier used apple products so the switch wasn’t hard, for new people it will take time.Bought from appario"

380,Rahul Purohit,Invest for a Long term👌😍,5,..Life review after 1 year of daily use. Its a long term investment.. A phone for many years. If you are changing your phone every year don't invest high on this... If you love❤ it.. Will go with you years. 😍. Remember..But it's not too light 198+with your back cover 220+..camera 5 ⭐. Never compare it's photo📷 quality with any mid range phone.. It's above any 64mp camera. 👌👌👌
381,Divyanshu,iPhone 11 - The Beast,4,"I have iPhone 11 (Red)Battery: 4.5/5 ⭐️Amazing battery backup given that it’s only close to 3000mAh capacity. Battery optimisation is great. Lasts a day if you use Instagram, WhatsApp, Safari, Camera, YouTube and call for 2-3 hours.Camera: 4.9/5 ⭐️iPhone is famous for its camera performance in day light and night time also. It can shoot upto 4k 60fps from both the front and back cameras.Performance: 4.9/5 ⭐️iPhone comes with A13 Bionic Chipset and it’s faster than all androids.Never lags, no bugs.P.S.

382,GaneshK,Great camera but outdated dispaly,4,If you are a media consumer like watching a lot of movie and exploring social media content ignore Iphone. But you want a high performance device which has a long durability you can prefer this.I don't see big flagship feature except camera and processing ability.I prefer to go with 1+ 8pro if i get a second chance or You already have a good phone then go for Ipad Pro Air 2020 with the same price
383,Aihtesham,Great product,4,Everything is fine only the battery little bit low but for normal use its good . Not recommend for gaming
384,Abhishek,Bole to ekdum zakaas,2,"Great phone, overall nice buy"
385,Sunny Charak,Super ....colour is osum,5,Super look...colour is osum....overall good
386,Siddharth,Overall Great Deal,4,I purchased this phone during Oct festive sale and I am happy with the product.If u wanna buy the phone I am assuming u have gone through tons of reviews and videos.Everything is good until I checked GPS. It’s not working properly each and every time. I am residing in Bangalore but my location is based in Romania😂And still I am unable resolve the issue. Hope a software update will fix this bug.
387,Gargi Mukherjee,Bang for the buck,5,I got it under 40 k in the sale.Value for money.Good battery life and also excellent camera.Rather than going for iphone 12 i chose this due to no major difference between them.
388,chitransh ,..,4,Good product as I hope
389,Priyanka Bhardwaj,No doubts if upgrading from an iPhone 6/6s/7/8 or earlier,4,"Upgraded from iPhone 6s 32 GB. Great Cameras (Wide, Ultrawide, and portrait modes). Exceptional battery life (Works up to 7 to 8 hours on iOS 14). Seamless experience. The phone is slightly heavier compared to the 6s. A faster chip (A13 Bionic). Face ID is great. WiFi and LTE(4G) support also is great. Great display regardless of it not being an OLED (iPhone 11 is LCD display), but colors are great. This phone is highly recommended instead of the 12, due to the battery size (iPhone 11 has 3110 mAh, iPhone 12 only has only 2815 mAh)."
390,Abhishek,Just Go For It,2,many of them saying they recieved with issues or already used product... but i got the new one with no problem so i would suggest not to fear that much but amazon should really give a good solution to the peoples who spent their hard worked money on device and got old one's or with problem that's all :)
391,Piyush chavhan,Charger Replacement.,5,Hi. I have received my iphone 11 white 64 gb on 7th September 2020. The charger is not working properly. Its not charging my phone properly as its very slow. I want a new charger as soon as possible. I am using iphone since 2015 and this is not how a iphone charger charges the phone. I have used a different charger on my iPhone 11 and its charging properly. I request you to please send provide me a new charger.

400,Aparna,Best value for money iphone,4,"Great iphone if you are looking for long term usage and durability, excellent cameras and performanceThe only con at this price is the charger provided is only 5 Watt takes a long time to charge even though the battery is small comparatively.If you are on budget and want to buy apple its the best value for money optionDisplay is still very good many people wont miss the oled from the pros."
401,Mikhil,Thank you amazon- Super amazing phone with proper delivery 🥰,5,"🔹First of all Thank you so much Amazon😇 for keeping up customer satisfaction on top.🔸Phone is no doubt- Super amazing.

404,Rohit,Seamless experience,4,"This is my 2nd purchase of apple on Amazon. No complaints till now. Delivery got a bit delayed but that’s fine. Blame goes to lockdown.Wont go by any pros or cons: if you are planning to buy this, means you have already researched everything.So coming to the point. This phone is just seamless like a butter. Value for money(in short)"
405,Lakshmi Yadav,"Good product,but there are things to improve.",5,"Battery life drains faster, camera sometimes looks grainy. It has significant weight to it.Even though the screen is lcd, it is very good..no problem there.As a person coming from android background there are somethings I really,like for example the notifications are not arranged intuitively, if you download any docs or photo there is no indication that it is completed.Overall a good product to buy."
406,Prabhata kumar jena,Awesome buy!,5,"Worth buying! It’s an extraordinary device! The only flaw I would say is the display! If you compare side by side to Amoled displays this display will feel dull! But it’s more than enough for a smartphone m! The the purpose of smartphone are many not just media consumption! And hey guys all this will be noticed only when you compare it!What I say is don’t compare! Coz this iPhone is far far better in its performance and usage irrespective of LCD display! ..especially the photos, video recording, editing, ppt, browsing, everything you throw at it! It does with ease.. an EASY YES for this mobile.."

409,1604,No need of intro,4,I am using this phone for last 2 yrs and so much happy and likely to upgrade with iPhone 14.....
410,Anonymous ,Love the feeling of iOS,5,"This is my first iPhone and I have been blown away by the performance of this phone. The experience of ios is so rich as compared to android. And once you get used to it you realise how easy and intuitive it is. It’s been 5 days and i am enjoying every moment using this phone. Android might offer more features but when it comes to overall experience, you can’t beat the iPhone. I say go for this phone without any hesitation."
411,Iresh D.,Iphone 11 128gb Black beast,5,"Got a July 2020 make, assembled in China, 128gb black variant with accessories and phone box including outer seal intact. Overall happy with the purchase. I am giving a 4 star because of the packaging. The box piece was delivered within a loose amazon packet which could easily damage the product while in transit. Appario should really put an eye on shipping and handling as we are paying a fair amount for the phone.Other than that everything looks good."
412,Shamsunder R.,Good and original iphone11,5,thanks for amazon do it continuously trust products
413,sharmila,Excellent phone in every terms,5,M writing this review after using iphone11 for 4 months. If you want to upgrade from Android to iOS this phone is best in terms of cost n quality . The only issue is it gets heat up on continuous use as every phone gets heated on continuous use for 2-3 hrs other than that it's good
414,Abhishek,Good Product,2,"It is good, but battery and camera needs improvement."
415,Akash Panday,Satisfied..,4,Whenever i decide to get i hav some confusion about selllers coz of ratings submited by users.. these apple product sold in amazon by two resellers 1. Darshita electronics 2. Appario retail pvt ltd.No.2 hav absolutely 91% positive response rate where no.1 hav only 87% that too many recent purchase people complaint that accesories missing heating issue like that.. but i got my mobile by appario.. its absoluely good no dought at all mobile also fine no issues no anything thnk u amazon... but these deliverys boys hamdlimg is wosrt part
416,Anbarasu,Value for money.,5,Got the 128gb variant on the very first day of sale with effective price Rs. 49999/-.Awesome battery life.Very good camera but can't say excellent.Display is not bad but could have been better.Face id is super smoothButter smooth multitaskingA bit of network issues sometimesOverall it's a very good smartphone and totally value for money in this priceLoved the device.
417,Vivek Ranjan,Worth buying for a smooth experience.,4,"Iphone 11 is one of the best in the market right now and i got it in sale, so it’s a bang for the buck.I received the product prior to the estimated delivery date and good service from amazon.A simple and subtle device yet a remarkable one.Well the notch and the face ID takes time to get used to but you won’t notice it much after a month or more.Battery life is goodCamera is one of the bestAnd the IOS is good as always."
418,Satya,Best Phone to buy especially on Amazon!,5,I bought apple iphone 11 128 GB black from Amazon during great Diwali Festival sale. I got the product within commited time. Delivery was as usal good and organized. No issues. iPhone is good. This is one of the best iPhone which apple can offer in these days considering overall build quility and latest features with advanced chip and most importantly good battery life.I am quite happy with my purchase as got additional discounts due to festive season.Once again Thank you Amazon for best offers on quality products.👍🏻
419,Amazon Customer,Pure Class!!,3,"iPhone 11, despite every critic or fan out there, will do one thing. It wouldn’t disappoint you. It keeps up the rock solid performance you’d expect out of an A13 Bionic. It’s camera is unlike any other. Battery life is good, not exceptional. Feels great in the hand. For those confused between product red and black, go for black like me because it’s not too flamboyant and more classy. 128 gb should be decent for most people. Anyone switching from Android to iPhone 11 will have a memorable experience."
420,Abhishek,"Superb purchase, value for money",2,Initially i was afraid of ordering i phone online but somehow i ordered and then thanks to amazon for delivering me original product. Delivery was somewhat slow but i thnk it was due to COVID situation.Overall good experience and very good product
421,Jyoti Suvarna,Iphone 11,5,"Premium feel. No words. Just awesome, but only issue is bit overheating while charging the phone. I am using 20W charger. I was bit afraid that i might get a soap bar but thankfully i did not.Note: My goodness this ecom express delivers very very late. Should have delivered fast."
422,Ansh Saxena,Switching from Android to iOS,3,"This is my first iOS device and being used to Oneplus devices expectations were pretty high with iPhone. iPhone literally has surpassed all my expectations and proven to be the best decision I’ve made. The battery life, camera quality, simplicity of UI and everything else is worth experiencing. I got this phone  of 128 gb during sale and paid 52,999 on no cost emi for 6 months.The price on Amazon was 6k less than the market price and the delivery was fast and phone was handled in right way."

Definitely improved my game..In short, I am happy with my New Iphone..Price was 48000/- and waiting for it didn’t go waste..Thanks to amazon for delivering it on same day.."

427,Heta Vashi,Amazing Device,5,"Its nothing new that iPhones are amazing. You can get the actual reviews on youtube easily. I would like to tell that as I switched from an Android to iOS, there is a very big change that I am experiencing. Camera quality, call clarity, every single aspect of the device is top notch. I got the 128 GB model and after installing all the necessary apps for social media, ecommerce and payments, I have around 20 GB occupied. So even the 64 GB model is great if you are not much into making videos."

429,Rishabh sharma,Best phone you can buy,3,"I switched to iphone from oneplus 8 pro , i have been an oneplus user since 3t, but 8 pro was so bad  and full of problems so i finally decided to switch to iphone and literally this is so much better than 8 pro , 8 pro was just marketing . Even the screen on this phone is better than the 8pro . This phone is a beast in every department . I purchased it only because of amazon sale at 48,000 i am really glad for the sale otherwise the price was too high"
430,Bharat Dixit,It's an iPhone,4,"Before this I was confused in what android to buy, camera quality, ram etc etc and then I decided to get my first iPhone. and trust me just the best decision. Camera blows anything out of the water it's that good. Performance is the best of all time. battery life is amazing as I am constantly getting 30% at the end of the day even after 6-7 hours of screen on time. Also the delivery was also very fast got it in two days only even in peak sale time"
431,Kindle Customer,It’s my black panther,5,No comments on apple productPros:1. Rich finishing2. Awesome battery life .You will get two days for normal usage. For hard users it will be one day strongly3. Marvellous photography using iPhone 11. Portrait mode is more attractive compare to previous versions. Wide angle camera Adds more attraction to the phone as well as more convenient while taking pictures.Night mode is awesome.4.front camera is very nice5.performance wise A13 chip never lags You in any instance.6.Finally the brand value Apple Apple apple. I got this phone at the better price in 47999.
432,Abhishek,Good affordable Upgrade,2,"I have upgraded from my iPhone 7 to 11 after 4 years. I have seen tremendous difference compare to 7. Battery life, Camera, Faster reading Face id, and bigger screen and other additional features. Everything going well. Mobile got delivered smoothly. Performing well. I am reviewing after 24 days I got the mobile everything going well."
433,Hemant Pathak,Premium yet retains the value,5,"Bought the green iPhone 11 for 50 in Oct 20 for 50k. Had missed the sale as did not find a 64 gb version in green colour then. The phone has lived to its expectation so far. Buttery smooth OS, excellent camera and most iOS apps have that sense of stability and reliability in them. Assurance to privacy has been another reason for switching over to iPhone.Face ID does give trouble once in a while and does not unlock the phone.Strongly recommend upper mid tier phone."
434,Aamirkhan,Look no further,5,"I never go by reviews. I have done intensive research differentiating between android and iOS. I previously was a big fan of Symbian OS. No wonder the most robust system in those days. Then, android & Windows took over Symbian monopoly.I was accustomed with symbian but had no choice to buy Sony Experia smart phone as Nokia got dissapeared. I somehow wasnt comfortable with Android stock apps and the way the overall file system.I then decided to try iOS and I never regretted to ever switch back to Android."
435,shaikh u.,"Not product review, its about Amazon ☺️",3,"Received original product one day before the mentioned date.I saw videos where most of the people said they received fake product from amazon, i was scared but it looks the people who make such videos are fake.This is my 4 mobile from amazon and all received products are original.In terms of iphone review no doubt about their quality and reliability.I am happy and satisfied customer of Amazon.Thankyou!!"

437,Amazon Customer,Great experience,4,Using since 20 daysGreat battery back up compared to all other cells and last for 2 days without charging as per normal use and 24 hours with continuous use.Camera as always best one with portrait mode going good.There should be more options in photo editing like text and other useful tool so we don’t have to use third party app.Overall great experience
438,Abhishek,An Apple a day keeps Android away 😁😃,2,"Brilliant phone with fantastic features at an unbeatable price. To all those naysayers comparing Android with iOS, I have just one thing to say - Use iOS once and then we’ll see who comes out trumps. Face ID Unlock is best in class, amazing camera clarity, super fast processor, iOS 14.1, Battery that lasts more than a day with a single charge. Do you wish for anything more? Nah. All things packed in one phone. The one, the only, the Master of all. My Phone - iPhone🙂"
439,Mohamed ismail,Perfect iphone as of now!!,4,"Was scared because of the negative reviews about the seller but still risked and took a chance because of the trust Amazon has build overtime and was not disappointed at all.Got the product in 1 day and the product was super fresh and brand new,I got the new box manufatured in February.So if you looking to buy this iphone after the price drop you can absolutely go for it❤️"

441,Umar,Highly discouraged with the Apple performance,5,"I had lots of expectation from this product but even just after unboxing and starting for configuration it started heating. It took 4.5 hour to recharge 60% bettery its very slow. I complained in the Amazone for return or replaced , they denied and ask to go to Apple service station for resolution. After checking at service station they says its normal and bettery will take 4.5 hours to charge its also normal. The bettery also drains very fast in4-5 hours. I have never expected such a bad profuct from apple like brand. And amazon is aslo not taking it for replacement. i simply wasted my money on brand.please never never purchase this product as even cheapest android will take not more then 1 hour in charging and will run for whole the day when new.I found few more customers like at service station complaining the same but they dont have answer and convincing them by saying same ' its normal'.. what a rabbish product with what a poor marketing from amazon...i highly discourged all of u not to buy this product ...Amazon is just doung marketing of this product they dont replace or refund ..."
442,Rikho,Nice iphone quality,5,Nice camera
443,bikash bhumij,Camera is poor,4,Phone heats when charge somtimes
444,Abhishek,Worth for price,2,iPhone 11 is worth for price I bought for 55999 ( 128 GB) on 19/08/2021 but inside the box only a mobile and lighting cable are available . They are  not providing a charger for that we have to buy separately. Otherwise the battery and camera and user experience is good.
445,Akshith varma,It's good 👍,3,Overall it's too good.
446,Amazon Customer,Gets heated up very hot while charging,5,The phone seems to be a duplicate as it gets heated up and becomes very hot and cannot touch whilst charging .Also volume is not loud . Where can I get it repaired or replaced .Not happy with this Apple phone
447,Ashutosh Yadav,Phone is best for under flagship category and for apple lovers. Better than iPhone 12,5,"I bought this in Amazon prime day sale and after using it for 3-4 months faced some issues with microphone. But I got it replaced by Apple authorised service centre, so works fine so far."

449,Walid A.,Iphone 11 pure class and style in your hand,5,I am writing this review after using it for 7 daysI am a first time apple userBattery life - Decent for 1 day useCamera- excellent awesomeDisplay-though its 720p hd screen but the ratina display is awesomeIos 13.5 latest ios version feel super fluid and snappyFace recognition is top notchOnly con i found is the slow 5 watt charger that takes around 3.5 hours to fully chargeI am surpirised there are so many negative review from Amazon but trust me friend the material the quality the feel of iphone you get is super awesome ..100% Genuine product..and thank you Amazon for such a great product and fast delivery
450,Abhishek,Best iPhone at this price,2,The best thing I like about it is it’s camera and performance.Privacy is no doubt the best.But it’s battery capacity is a bit low and it got discharged in 6 hours only if used continuously.The smartphone also has a heating issue.Otherwise This iPhone 11 is a beast.I got it for 55k only so I will say that in this price the smartphone is best.If you are looking for a better premium smartphone then don’t think just go for it.The delivery was also very fast. I got it within 4 days.
451,Sandeep agarwal,Think before you buy,5,"Switched from Android to iOS. Pretty hard for couple of days to use it. Its not so simple as android. Very hard to move your data from android to iphone.Once you get used to it, you will love it.Below rating are after using it for a week.Camera 5/5Battery 3/5Display 4/5Sound 5/5Performance 5/5Earphone sound output 3/5Overall 4/5"
452,Kuldeep Bhargav,Very op phone for gamers and normal users this seller is genuine no doubt,5,no doubt for the quality of apple's phones genuine seller anyone can go for it
453,suraj manjanna,Another quality product from Amazon,5,"In 2019 I bought iPhone 7 Plus in flipkart, but they have sent tampered mobile for me, after 6 months mother board was gone and mobile stopped working. In 2020 I bought iPhone 11 in Amazon. What a mobile it is, awesome price and peice. Amazon products are always genuine over flipkart. I strongly suggest you can buy products on Amazon they are genuine"
454,SHABD BHANDARI,Scratches on glass,5,"Like the build quality of phone, camera and battery life and of course the OS.But what I can observe in last 15 days of use, the screen with lots of scratches. Didn’t expect this from Apple and the cost of phone. Apple mention it’s a strong glass but It can get easily scratched. Guys buy best quality screen protector with this phone."
455,piyush moriani,Nice,5,Nice
456,Abhishek,Amazing,2,"I had iPhone 7 and now shifted to iPhone 11. I love the camera, battery life and simply everything... it looks cool... everything is working fine haven’t registered for esim though... Amazing according to me not sure about android users but iPhone users will find it amazing.... still this pack has the normal charger but apple has released new one with type c... only drawback I found"
457,vishnu,Great device but received reboxed iPhone,5,soon after removing the film from screen I noticed a slight scratch on the screen. This should happen if the product is directly sold from the Apple store. I think it was returned or reboxed item. The film from screen wasn’t aligned properly and has bubbles with dust in it. I got so disappointed after seeing this.Please don’t purchase from online if Apple Store is available in your city or purchase from Apple.com
458,Asha,Awesome phone,5,"One word - wonderfulBattery life - Very Good. Will take you through the day and to the next if you are an average user. Heavy users can rely on the battery for one full day. The phone doesn’t really heat up except while using some heavy apps (once in a while). But not bad at all.The camera is great, as expected.Face recognition is awesome. My phone recognises me even in the dark. And thankfully the phone recognises me and only me. Quite smart 😃I have used the phone for over a month now."
459,Jokson Thomas,Nice Product,5,Loved it
460,Tapiyar Moyong,Awesome experience,5,Excellent phone.. we need to spend another 5k for accessories like charger and headphones.. otherwise it’s excellent product purchase for 49k.. love it
461,∆DITY∆,The best iphone in the world 😊😊😊😘❤️,5,One of the solid phone which I have used.I have updated from iPhone 7 to iphone11.The only draw back in iPhone 7 was battery life.But I don’t face any issues in iphone11. It stands out through out the day.Spatial audio is ultimate feature 😘❤️
462,Abhishek,Apple now become smart seller,2,"Processor- till now only few applications I have downloaded and operated, but first time I have seen that now it’s very easy to download app in apple store & without charge(seems weird) ...in the times when fake phones are available & sold through same platform. Few applications struck during operation and I need to forcefully close it to come out of that app. It’s happening  from first day....feels weird after spending 60kCamera - it looks normal as compared what apple claims.Headphones- poor quality, I have used I phone headphone in past & their quality is much better than what I have received. Wire quality is pathetic. Even Rs.700 senisser quality is much better.Charger- similar to headphone they also seems pathetic, so thin & delicate that you will start doubting about their life.Charging time- it took almost 3.5-4 hours tafri complete charge & just 2 hour to completely drained out if you are using in continuous.Still I am looking for more clues so this phone feels me genuine & worth of my spending"
463,Pramod Gupta,Camera is quiet impressive,5,I like it’s battery performance the most
464,Rajat K.,iPhone User,4,Always have loved quality of Apple. I personally feel iPhone 11 is a best pick. I loved the Camera Quality. Delivery of the product  was so smooth. Complain I have is the charging adapter which you don't  get with the phone which you have to buy from shop or online store.  Which could be waste of money. Overall I'm  fallen for the device.  Looking forward for some good pictures.
465,Saddam Husain,The Best Camera Quality.,5,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 One of the best Smartphone. compared to all other phones. We know the quality of iPhones. Especially, the Camera Quality, Display, features & Eco-system. So, I’m lucky to get this phone on offer. Thank you, Amazon. As Always!."
466,Pranav Palkar,Amazing,5,Simply super😍
467,Mohammed arshad,Awesome battery life poor charging speed,5,Battery is plus and minus both at the same time that’s why 4 star. I charge it on Friday night that lasts up to Sunday night. One major drawback is poor charging time. I normally plug charger once 6% battery is left to avoid charging discharging cycle of battery. The supplied 1amp charger takes 2.5 hours to reach 100%.
468,Abhishek,Good phone,2,All good

473,Amazon Customer,A perfect package,5,Being my very first iOS device after using android for a decade I would say that Its a really nice device with amazing features and a top notch camera.The A13 Bionic chip takes care of all the multitasking and heavy apps like cakewalk. Battery life is unexpectedly good as compared to the previous models. Overall its a good device to go for in this price range.
474,Abhishek,Great Camera Great Battery & Not so great Display,2,"this is the best premium midrange phone, forget the Chinese brands they dont even come close to the build quality & experience Apple have, dont buy phones by comparing spec sheets iPhones are super well optimized gives the best experience, iOS is butter smootg & feels great, camera is unbeatable, battery life is strong the only negetive is the low refresh rate so instagram scrolling experience is really bad but lcd displays are much softer to the eyes ao u’ll strain less"
475,Patel hir,Bang for the bucks,5,"Ok if your reading the reviews i'm sure you know all the specifications the phone and your probably skeptical about buying online. So, i received my package in 5days in good condition. Also the product was original as i went to apple's website to confirm it.The camera capabilities of this phone is mindblowing. And if your upgrading from older iphones like iphone 8 and prior, you will be amazed by this phone. Though I wouldn't recommend anyone with iphone x models to buy this phone."
476,Amazon Customer,Good product,4,Good product delivered on time
477,Amazon Customer,Nice phone,5,I phone always good
478,pankaj bora,Didn’t provide me with my bonus cashback,5,The product is premium and well in shape but these amazon people are _______ . In offer section they’ll show plenty of rewards and chash back but when you purchase it then nothing will be given. I purchased iphone11 during GIF SALE there was a bonus cashback of₹1250 but ther fail to provide it sayin offer is not on iphone11
479,Asir,Disppointed as wrong description given,5,Phone is stylish and i am first time apple user .its look good and it would be too early to comment as i got the phone today only. I am disappointed as it was shown the airpods with the phone but instead of that they send the wired earphones. If someone is buying the phone in 60k plus he or she should be given the things which is mentioned at least.  I am waiting if the airpods are being sent by the seller else will return the phone due to wrong description . How ever other things are fine and looks are great. Will give a brief review later. Thank you
480,Abhishek,Nice,2,
481,Ajitm,Awwwesome device - iPhone 11 White 128 GB,4,Phone design and build looks premium. Camera quality is excellent and night mode works really well. Battery life is awesome lasts for a day or little more than that on moderate usage.Pros:Battery lifeSecurity - I moved from android so I can feel the differenceFace ID - works even on pitch dark environmentBest processor A13 BionicBest cameraCons:Display could be been Oled or amoled. It’s just Liquid Retina displayOther than that excellent device to use. Can feel the performance without any lags what so ever.

484,A6unRaj,Superb,4,"Battery backup not Better yet.,"
485,Atul Verma,Brand worth it,3,"After 2 day of use i found worth it Camera quality is very good before buying I’m bit worried by reading reviews about heating issue and hanging issue, at first time charge phone bit heated but manageable after that no heat issue as such I haven’t played game coz not a fan of games and all. Battery backup is also decent. Only drawback i see is that at this huge price only 5w slow charger is provided"
486,Abhishek,Awesome product,2,"Batter life is very good compared with older version's of Iphone. I am charging once in two days :-)Face id is too good, it is working in dark also and its seamless.Siri is slowed after upgrading to ios14Apple carplay is awesome, there is no lag. And you can play the songs, send messages through SIRI while driving.Camera is verygood , and we can change the portrait modes after taking the pictures. Pictures in night are not effective comparing with daylight."
487,Sharma Ji ka Ladka,Awesome phone..,5,"I always had an impression that iPhones are overrated and not worth the price. Was using OnePlus phones which where a bit low in price compared to iPhones and it is a great phone as well, but thought of giving it a go in this Prime Sale and ohh god, iPhones are surely amazing phones. The camera and sound quality is top notch.. Surely moving from Android to iOS gives you some trouble using initially but it happens while switching to any new phone. I love the phone, still find it a bit pricy but a great phone."
488,Sayak chandra,Must Buy If Pocket Allows You,5,All of it gives me a joyful moment n makes me happy everytime... That I should go for it earlier and I’m late for purchasing it .Its killer look is fantastic but I love pro size but I don’t like it’s three cameras setup so i go for it . Worth every penny must buy product if ur pocket allows you to buy hope U won’t regret after purchase..... Update u later Now let’s take a break ba bye N Take Care
489,Amazon Customer,Dnt hesitate to buy,5,Good
490,Sumit Sharma,Best price for iPhone,5,"The iPhone 11 is probably the best value for money phone for people who desire flagship phones from known brands, until of course, the iPhone 12 is launched. The phone has great battery life, and a fantastic camera. The Chip is extremely fast and, as always, the iOS is probably the most user friendly UI available. The purchase experience was good, i got a reasonable discount, even though the no cost EMI option was only available on thee Amazon Pay credit card. I do feel that amazon is probably trying to encourage of their ‘in-house’ card and hence discourage the no cost EMI on other cards."
491,goutam si,Good phone hopefull that it will last long,5,"Worth the cost.Battery  life is good. After 40hrs of moderate use 35% of battery was still remaining.The usage was with location,Bluetooth ,mobile data turned off ,wifi on and display brightness set for the lowest possible for viewing  clearly.Display , touch, faceid is good. Face id doesn unlock if eyes are closed.Camera clarity is too good along with night mode.Adapter in the box is not satisfactory. I have a fast charge capable  power bank and charge my iphone by using power bank. So 30 to 100 % charge happens in about 1hr."
492,Abhishek,❤️ Android,2,"it will be an understatement if i say iPhone 11 was the worst purchase of my life. i have been using android for as long as i can remember, and iOS doesnt give the flexibility of an Android. I used my brand new iphone for 2 whole days and i was done. i highly doubt if i will ever buy an iPhone ever again.Venting aside, below are the problems i encountered in the 2 days:> My 2 year old OnePlus gives the same battery backup as my 2 day old iphone> THERE IS NO FINGERPRINT SCANNER!! and the password is a 6 digit code, n it frequently keeps asking to enter this rather than unlock my phone with face id.> There is a limited set of alert tones available, each of which is so loud i was startled every single time i got a msg. PS. i use whatsapp for work extensively, there will be at least 60 diff groups im part of. you can imagine how horrible will it be to hear dolby digital kind of sounds before you even wake up> Whatsapp Web just doesnt sync real time. sometimes i get msg in my macbook first and few seconds later, the horrible startling tone is heard from the iPhone>I couldnt transfer anything from my android, the step to transfer data etc from android failed some 20 times before i gave up, i lost all my whatsapp back up, it was a mess.> I used the same SIM as in my OnePlus and i started facing frequent call drops, for the first time"
493,Parag Rv,One of the best with reasonable price from Apple,5,Excellent performance and feels the best in hand.Everything you throw at it will run on it with butter smoothness. Although there is slight heating issues while video calling on mobile data and also on gaming with graphics at very high.The main camera and selfy camera is great. Wide angle could be better. But the videos are great from all these cameras.
494,Sumit Radhe,Brilliant Phone.,5,"The phone is great. Seamless performance, amazing camera and good battery life considering that this is an iphone. The display is great even though it being a 720p lcd display it looks better than most oled displays. The only con is that the colour black is not exactly black its a weird shade of grey I’d recommend purchasing any other colour other than “BLACK”. Last but not the least Amazon was just brilliant at delivering the product, got the phone on the same day."
495,Amazon Customer,Original product. Perfect for a budget iphone purchaser.,5,"Don't be scared of ordering things online, myself checked it from Apple store these are originals but yeah they are some glitch while using it, but they are managble. Over all the product is genuine and original."
496,Aman Aryan,Awesome pictures quality 👌👌,5,
497,Abha,Only 5G is missing.,5,I bought this for my wife. Easy to use. Best camera. Best smartphone for videography.FaceTime is the best feature to go for. Call quality and video are crisp and clear.Battery life is good but it’s too thick to handle.Only thing I miss in this phone is 5G feature.However it’s not yet available in India but a device has to be future proof.
498,Abhishek,Iphone 11 is still a great buy in 2020!,2,Bought this for sister in Great Indian Festival offer at 49K. Its a great deal as iphone 11 is quite a power packed device even compared to iphone 12. Bionic 13 chip is fast for day long uses. Display is fantastic and camera is  quite useful. This pro grade product is definitely going to last for next five years.
499,Rrahul Gandhi,BATTERY 🔋,5,Bad battery 🔋
500,Bhaskar ,Superb phone loved it and I got  Rs.39K in Big Pre Diwali sale thanks Amazon,4,
501,Laksh Agarwal,Great deal,4,Iphone at lowest price ever. It was a great deal to buy iphone in big billion days sale. Thanks amazon for this deal. Iphone could have better battery back-up.
502,Jeevan,Happy with the purchase!,5,"Well i was very worried about the phone after reading all the reviews and all but my phone was all fine...There isn't any heating issue nor os it used. I even checked its authenticity online and it was all well and good.So, the phone is new and works very well.Camera quality is awesome and the colour looks just gret! I am totally in love with rhe face recognition, its super fast! So anyone who wants ro buy it can totally go for it!"
503,Kiran.,Worst,5,"Don't buy this product, after 6month phone not working, visited apple service center they found some duplicate part inside phone. They not delivering original product guys."
504,Abhishek,Good product with limitations and switch back if possible,2,"Battery life is BAD. In around 40 days “Battery Health” fell to 99% and on 46th day to 98%. Also, getting acknowledgment from Apple’s Support Team of ‘there’s an issue with battery’ is a task as for them battery is behaving normally.Good product and one should explore seller option just to explore better quality.I’m honestly thinking of switching back to Android OS considering limitations with Apple’s quality of product."
505,ANAMIKA,Very heat phone,5,Like
506,kirti kachhawa,Good,5,Good
507,vijay sundar mishra,Review,5,"I am pleasantly surprised by its battery life. Once fully charged, i didn't feel any need to recharge it again in a day. The iphone 11 as a whole package is really good. I have been an android user and switching to iphone didn’t disappoint me. As far as iphone camera is concerned, i found it a bit less effective /good than google pixel camera . Google pixel camera was outstandingBut Nevertheless, a good buy"

509,Prachi,Good product,5,Nice product
510,Abhishek,First Apple Device,2,For first time buyers. Don’t buy an iPhone if you are not willing to enter its ecosystem of other devices. It’s waste of money without ecosystem.Stay with Android. It’s far more flexible using Android.Great product by the way. Screen size is smaller. But you will get used to it in a month.
511,Pankaj n Alshi,4.5 outta 5,4,"Absolutely wonderful. Works like butter, has been a user of mid range android from beginning so wanted to use. Got green one 128 gb for almost 51.5k and I'd say a good price for it would be bw 45k-50k. The battery performance for normal usage, the video camera, easy to use. Loved it.And mfs delivered it in 4 frickin days like wtf. But anyways if u are wanting to try apple its worth it buying an year old device lol."
512,amandeep,Heating issue solved for iPhone 11,5,"I was also facing the heating issue with iPhone 11, bought in recent sale. After updating to ios14 the device was getting hot a lot and with no heavy use also. For me it got solved by factory resetting the iPhone 11 from settings. It’s reset all data and setting option . Since then it’s working fine for me no more heating issue. For those who bought it new and having heating issue, please try this hope it will work.👍"

Thankfully, i did not face any issues with the seller or the product.my phone was well packed and sealed and delivered within the stipulated time. warranty too was one year after activation of the phone .As for the phone, its just awesome, fast, great battery, great camera. If you are looking for an upgrade and want to purchase the iphone 11, go ahead."
521,Tarun sengar,Phone is DEAD after exactly 2 years,5,"Today is almost the 2nd anniversary of my purchase and the phone died overnight...unable to restart, even a hard reboot. The Apple Authorised Service and repair shop says it'll cost approx Rs. 40,000 to fix and any data not on icloud will be lost."

524,Sabyasachi Mondal,Wonderful Phone at a Great price.,5,"Thanks to Amazon's ""The Great Indian Shopping Festival"" I got the best deal for this phone compared to other sites. I think I was one of the early bird to avail this great offer. It would be stupid to give a phone review for a year old phone but for me it's perfect piece of machine at a very reasonable price. Special mention goes to the early delivery made by the Amazon courier service.Thank you Amazon for this wonderdul deal."
525,Ketan,Genuine product but with minor issue,4,Phone had German language installed by default and still I’m not able to completely replace it. Bit disappointing. Otherwise product is genuine and no issues so far.
526,ॐPraSsadॐ,Very good phone and average delivery,5,I am writing this review after using it for one day. It cost me around 53k in Sell. I am happy with my purchase camera quality is very good specially in low light and the performance is awesome.

529,Amit agarwal,"Fast, Literally. Outstanding Camera!",5,"An amazing Phone. I switched from Android to iOS and it’s too good. This device is really fast with the A13 Bionic chip. The camera and the different modes as well as the Portrait feature is just outstanding. Don’t go for 12 if you are greeting 11 at such a great price. I got it at 44.9k which included and exchange of an older phone plus discounts on cc and Amazon cash back. Overall, the best phone in this range."
530,SWAPNIL NAKATE,The best you can get in this price bracket,4,I bought it for 50k in Amazon great indian sale & for this price this phone is absolute value for moneyPRO- HandyFace unlock is nexy level works like some science fiction stuffwhite color and aluminum finish looks dopeBattery life is also greatPhone Speakers are loud enoughCall quality & internet speed is amazing specially where network is weak or somethingCON-Display (it's just 720p LCD Display) but again quality is top notch
531,manoharan,Better than Android,4,"This one is a no brainer, I have been using Samsung flagship for almost 4 years and I'd just feel much smoother thanks to A13. Surprisingly this has been a very good experience considering I thought I would feel like a prisoner in Apple e. Whatever you can do in android you can do it here, it's just that there is a long and tiring process to do it. Definitely recommended you won't regret buying this."
532,Keerthana A.,Review after 2 months,5,"Even though lcd display much better than budget amoled displays, Nice camera, Around 5 hrs screen on time. Overall a good phone if you are a normal user."

534,Abhishek,Phone has heating issue.,2,My unit has heating issue & I couldn't replace my device as I couldn't produce job-sheet from Apple service centre.  This was due to unavailability of service centre near me. Now I am enjoying a phone with heater this winter....😥

I'm a diehard fan of android and Samsung mobiles but this apple 11 changed my opinion about iPhone. This is a gift to my loved one.. now I'm also planning take iPhone once my android mobile dies... amazon delivered mobile well in time and the product is as specified.. I read many reviews that they got faulty iPhone. In my case luckily it's a genuine product and Amazon always delivered genuine products only to me.

I was a bit concerned until my order arrived .  But once it was within hand i felt relaxed . As the product is brand new and also there is nthg to worry abt the damage plus it also has 1 year apple warranty ! . In short i would rate amazon 5/5 for delivery on time and with all safety precautions."
542,Amazon Customer,The battery life is worst. I bought the phone because of the camera quality. Not good for gaming.,5,The battery life is worst. I bought the phone because of the camera quality. Not good for gaming.

544,Durga Royalcheruvu,Overall Basic review after one week usage.,5,"Camera Quality is absolutely amazing.Battery is good compared to previous iPhone models . But if you play high end games like PUBG (continues), you will only get 5-6 hours of battery backup.Face ID is amazing. A lot of tech youtubers say that display is not good , but believe me you won’t notice any problem with the display.Night photography is really amazing feature, probably my favourite.Overall, I will give a 4.8 out of 5."
545,Sagar dhiman,Still the best in even in 2021!!,5,Just go for it if you have a range of 50k.instead of going for android phone thinking it’s 5G and amoled display.ios is way better than android once you get used to it
546,Abhishek,India assembled ❤️ About Apprio pvt ltd seller,2,After Reading so much negative reviews on internet for Appario sell pvt ltd i am afraidBut when I receive the phone everything is fine packaging was genuine and good all stuff goodBest part is I received  assembled in India variant❤️Phone is blazing fastCamera beastBattery backup very goodOnly.

550,NASRIN,Disaaponited with amazon service,5,Product is good and original but i'm very much dissapointed with amazon service.Earlier it was clearly mentioned that if i made payment throgh HDFC credit card i get 1750 rs instant discount 1250 rs cashback with in 3 days of shipment and till date i didn't get any cashback. I have also called 3-4 times to amazon customer care and now they are saying this offer is not applicable in i phone.Very dissapointed 👎
551,Minal Kalpesh Deore,"If you don't have an iPhone, You Don't have an iPhone",5,"Thank You Amazon, i have received a seal Pack iPhone 11. I was curious before due to the negative reviews I have read before, due to high deman i was not able to order the iPhone, but after retrying so many times i was finally able to orde it.Switching from OnePlus 6.Man what a Phone it is, Really loving my iPhone. It was seal pack, contain all the accessories mentioned as in the title of the product."
552,Abhishek,So far so good,2,Overall the phone is really fantastic except the weight of the phone which has a bit more compare to latest models. Camera quality as good as a 20k android phone. iphone 12 got best design and is easy to hold in hands where iphone 11 is not. It slips from my hands atleast once or twice a day.
553,Ravi P.,Marvellous phone,5,The iPhone 11 is one hell of a phone. Though 2 year old model but could easily take on today's flagship phones. Camera quality is awesome. Quality of sound in Apple music beyond imaginable. Battery life is better than most of the android phones.In one word it's a WONDER

556,jijesh raoji,Welcome iOS !!! Exciting Moment,5,I loved Apple for years and finally experiencing the joy of handling it !! Wow very nice experience from out of Box (Android). Outstanding product always !!Found lack of awareness with delivery person in exchange process and it took time to touch my iphone...Other than no issues found in delivery of product in fact I have received it before the timeline. Thank you !!Everything is Amazing with Amazon.
557,mohit kumar,Security,5,Amazing delivery by amazon i never thought that this much of security . Firstly i was little bit of nervous after seeing some reviews that this seller is not good so i was quit nervous bcoz 50k is huge money but after seeing the security and seeing the product i was very happy and i was using this phone since 2mnths i haven't seen any issues
558,Abhishek,If you’re worried about the product. Give it a read.,2,"As you all know, how scared all the online buyers  were because of all the news around about the scam of iphones. So recieved it finally today. Took a bit long but just so relieved!!!! Its perfect. Nothing to worry about. I decided to write reviews about the purchases done recently once i recieve my phone and get all relieved. So here is this. Everything is in the box. All safe. All good. Thumbs up 👍👍"
559,divyam anand,u can buy in this price range,5,"1st time bought an apple product, fully different experience. The OS is not user friendly like android but it's interesting.The camera quality is quite impressive. The night camera is also good, but there is a little issue which I was not supposed, and ie. when you move ur hand or any non-living object it blurs the image and I was supposing that iPhone will fix it... But the sensor is very good... face detection is awesome..."
560,Sachin Kumar,Battery getting heat soon,4,Color is fantastic
561,Pradeep,Too much heat while charging the phone,3,Just shake of apple brand phone
562,jessy,Charger not good,5,Everythin about phn is so good.Only thing that i did not like is the adapter given for charging..It is of 5W only and it take almost 2.5 to 3 hra to charge your phn to 100%.When. You are spending so much amount then we should expect from apple to provide with compatible charger as they are giving in pro and max pro..
563,Nani,It's an iPhone!,4,"It is an iPhone. Period. Everything is amazing. Battery life is lesser than most next gen Android phones but it is so optimized that it lasts easily for 1 day with heavy usage. Camera is top-notch and since I switched from Android to Apple, it is the little features in iPhone that surprise you."
564,Abhishek,Scintillating festive deal in AGIF Sale,2,"Just amazed buy the great Indian festival sale, got benefited by the offer, I waited for 24 hrs others I would have got 1k advantage. The black version of it feels premium, camera, battery and display are optimised in the updated version of iOS 14. Yet to explore more of its claims. Just loved it, Amazon is systematic in delivery design layout.  It's  camera performance just adds icing to the memories you want to capture."
565,Debabrata Chakraborty,One of the best smartphone,5,Only one word for this phone - it's a beast. Battery life is really good. I charge it once in 2 days with minimal usage (4-5 hours with personal hotspot on). Display is really good even if it is an LCD display. Go for it without having a doubt. My device is currently on IOS 13.6.1. I would recommend you to watch few YouTube videos about bad battery life on IOS 14 and then upgrade your device. Cheers
566,Krishna,As expected - it’s a genuine iPhone and genuine seller,5,Today is my 10th day with this fantastic phone. While ordering I was little confused as have read some real bad reviews buying an iPhone on Amazon but so far I am very Happy with the delivery process and overall performance. Phone is working perfectly fine without any glitch. Sync with my iPad and apple account in just one click. Bought this during Amazon season sale and ICICI card so it’s the best price you can get anywhere.

No comparison with so called android 108mp camera, u get studio quality photos, lastly , amazon deal was cherry on the cake with all accessories. Go fr it !"

It depends on the buyer who will refer what before investing.1. This phone has no fingerprint scanner.2. The camera app must have some exclusive features.3.

606,Abhishek,Worthy but battery is poor,2,Really good as i feel initially. But iOS has restrictions it doesnt allow apps to perform certain functions. I am not able to use to my office apps and need a support of android phone. Also the battery back up is very bad. Need to charge at least twice daily
607,Haineuwangbe Kuame ,Love it,5,I am writing this review after using couple of months I would say it's a very good phone and I love it.
608,Sajid,Best camera,5,Camera is best but do not buy if you need to change or replace this item Amazon not accept return or exchange
609,Prabhu ,Good phone but though for first time Apple user,5,After handling the phone now I can get convinced for the price as the make and user interface is really amazing but there are some corns for me because I am a long-time Android user so I believe it takes time for me to get into fully. The main concern is the headphone jack as we have only two options one we have to use lightning cable or Bluetooth headphones. Other than that it is really a great phone for professional users with a royal look.

612,Abhishek,Best Buy,2,So I got my hands on this beautiful purple iPhone 11 and it feels amazing.I upgraded from iPhone 8 to 11 and tbh the 3 year old iPhone 8 is still in the best condition .This is what makes me go for iPhone again and again .I’ve had android in the past and the thing that keeps me loyal to iPhone is that it gives me ZERO LAG and the BEST PICTURE QUALITY.
613,Shashidhara,Good phone,4,I don’t need to review the phone. Nowadays we all do our research whole buying an iPhone or other expensive phones. This review is just to let tou know that I received the phone and not a stone or a soap. Just ensure that the box is properly sealed meaning there’s is a plastic wrap over the box and a sticker at the edge of the box opening.
614,Lalit a.,Decent product at such price,5,"Product is premium in appearance you can’t complaint about it.But the battery life is not so good.Also, there are some bugs with ios 14 which need to be resolve.Camera is fantastic even in night but wide angle camera is not good at night.Face ID is decent in response."
615,Savi,Battery health 99percent in one month,5,"Some time I face fingerprint problem, use key 2,3 times for press. Battery health is 99percent in one month of purchasing. And is also not good"
616,Arpita Halder,Perfect to perfection,5,Great product (which was indeed expected) as Apple always delivers the best.Switched from iPhone 6 and this has been the perfect switch.. Great battery life with such faster face recognition. And you won’t find a better camera in the market than this (specially the night mode)But thanks to Amazon for delivering the product without any issues. I’m saying this because I ordered the phone at 10pm and it was delivered the next day at 9:30am which was completely unexpected in these lockdown days.
617,kunal Sonawane,Go for it! Good job by Appario Seller!,5,"I was scared about the originality of the product. I’ve conducted all the necessary checks to identify if the product is original. It is absolutely a original one. Alternatively, I walked in to the Aptronix store and took their help to get a confirmation about product Authenticity. It is confirmed - an original iPhone 11 by Apple and the seller Appario.Hope I’ll have a good time with my new iPhone 11."
618,Abhishek,Super mobile,2,"This is very good phone, it has display, camera and battery inside Mobile. It is made in China where Chinese people produce this product. But Chinese people are good.

Indoor seems to be good, not great.Battery was awesome, I heard iPhone battery never last for the day. But this one is exceptional. At the same time, charging time is high. At least requires couple of hour to load and 100% battery.iOS simply awesome and flawless. Working smoothly!White iPhone is truly awesome and premium, loved it. Simply go for it."

641,Arsalaan Ahmed,Best ever phone,5,Battery life is not very good but normal use it works from 100 to 20 percent for 21 hours. If heavy user of mobile then 17 hours but u need to charge at least once every days. Camera quality can’t be beaten by any other device. It’s really best . Face recognition is best in mid night also.  I will give 98 out of 100 2 marks cut for battery issue. Which is not a big issue.
642,Abhishek,It’s a good smartphone but some apps r not running in this device so i give 3 points for this iphone,2,Face id is perfect but when u wear mask then type ur password it’s so difficult nd 2nd is battery life is not sufficient it’s not complete ur whole day but camera quality is so far better other smartphones

No fingerprint reader but extremely quick face ID. Good camera - the apple trademark. Moving from android is slightly tiresome if the move to iOS app isn’t working but contacts and other details can be pulled from google emails/drives."

Fortunately amazon delivery this time was good (my past delivery experience have been bad).On downside, this phone is heavy as brick. Compared to similarly sized s10... this is too heavy.  Single hand use easily tired fingers and hand. Pictures are great but the wide angle is not good on people as it distorts edges in pictures. Speaker sound is also slightly mutted. Face id fails occasionally.I can live with most of the issues but the weight of phone is dissapointing"

But after a week, all my issues shorted out. M enjyng the best camera. Initialy m a oneplus user. Addicted to best cameras. Researchd alot to buy this iphone 11.

 There is nothing extraordinary or something like that with the iphone compare to overall flagship android device i have been using, but the ecosystem & the iOS experience is kind of different & fluid and it's a good experience to have a Apple Device for first time. Worth for around 50k, glad i didn't go with the 85k iphone-12 not much a difference according to my usage. Battery is more than i expected, Camera quality is great when it comes to video recording, photos aren't that great."

682,Anu Vashisht,iPhone left sound is not working properly,5,The left sound is not working since I received the product. Due to some circumstances I was not able to return the product in given return period. Its a request to the customer care or centre head if possible replace the product.
683,prajwal ,Great pick for dual sim users who are obsessed with getting good pictures!,5,"The delivery got delayed by a day but the product came with good packaging and I have verified the product on Apple website to ensure that the product is genuine.Jio and Airtel offer esim in India, so be mindful when you read that iPhone supports dual sim. It supports one esim and one nano sim.Great camera. Bulkier than other older iPhone models. Display and sound quality is amazing!"
684,Abhishek,Happy with the purchase😊,2,I ordered the phone in Amazon great Indian sale and original product got delivered by Darshita Electronics(seller) .I'm writing the review after 2 months usage and till now I haven't faced any issues with the phone. Camera quality is just awesome. Loved the product ❤️
685,gaurav,Just make sure you have good and innocent delivery guys ( which os impossible to know ),5,Firstly i was afraid buying from amazon dur to all these stupid uet scaring reviews but after recieving the phone i couldn’t be more satisfied just one word you all know what it is come yaar its apple no comment required on the quality awesome camera battery and specially performance for me personally as a gamer its the thing that matters the most .
686,Amazon Customer,Disappointed!!,5,I cannot believe that you guys didn’t not even mention that you would not dispatch the Charging cable and Ear phone. Should mention it. I live in Canada and I am totally disappointed. Would report it to Apple Canada that it’s what happening. Disappointed !!!
687,Golu singh,"Good mobile for the current price of Rs 59,900 in Amazon.",5,"Battery life is quite good in the new iPhone 11. For my daily use the battery lasts for more than 36 hr.Could get a discount of Rs 6,400 for exchanging my iPhone 6s Plus.Face ID recognition works very well.There is no fingerprint scanner.Yet to study the camera quality."
688,Deepak,Happy to have this phone,5,"Again editing my review after using it for almost 2 weeks, initially, on call volume was soo low that on every call i had to put on speaker but that problem solved itself. So phone is doing great till now . Only thing is charging adapter comes only of 5w which is charging very slow, so had to buy 12w adapter separately. Overall happy with product"
689,Arindam Bhowmik,Amazing camera quality and features,3,"I switched from an Android to an iPhone and it was The BEST decision I've ever made, people say that most of the iPhone users just use them for the logo and that there are not much features, I said it too but now I know why everyone has these phones.

Thank you amzone for ur wonderful service. Feeling so lucky .. Thank you so much. Trust worthy service 🙂"
701,Shankar,My dream was fulfilled!,4,"From a very long time, I had been planning to buy an iPhone and the Great Indian Festival sale made it happen! I could buy the iphone 11 at ₹52,999! at mid night when the sale kick started for prime members!! Thank you Amazon for the amazing price. iPhone 11 was a great buy with all the accessories in the box unlike 12😋"
702,Abhishek,Beauty. Go for it.,2,"It’s absolute beauty. If you’re in doubt about the display, believe me (for someone who’s coming from an android oneplus 5)don’t hesitate at all. It has a very good display. Now don’t go into the numbers.Also, it has a mind blowing cameras and it'll win your heart. Ultra wide is more useful but it comes down to personal preference and the front camera is also great.You’ll love the experience.11pro is a great phone no doubt but 11 and 11pro has slim differences really. And it surely isn’t worth the 35k difference for the better screen,extra camera and the fast charger in the box.(Both 11 and 11pro support fast charging).ConsIt’s just that you can’t transfer whatsapp backup from android onto your ios."
703,Manish sharma,Disappointed with Product,3,"Received my iPhone 11 today, delivery was good but there contains dust particles inside the camera which disappointed me.However i discussed with Apple care and they said that the authorised service center will get this cleaned."
704,Jyothi,Great phone with mind blowing performance,3,The phone is awesome and delivered the performance as expected.Bought it on Amazon great Indian festival but they not provided the Cashback offers as promised on the phone when I made the purchase.The Amazon changed the offer for iPhone after 2 days of sale and now they denying to provide the Cashback amount.Should have bought from somewhere else.
705,lalit sharma,A great device,3,"I ordered white colour with 128 gb. I m simply loving it. It's powerful and helps in multitasking. Yeah it gets heat a bit but if you use it properly, it does wonderful job. The colour is beautiful, it functions great, overall, it's a great deal in 52,999"

707,Hemambara Naidu,Very Poor glass quality for iPhone 11 as compared to the older versions..,5,experience is great for now.. however another feedback is that within 20 days I noticed a tiny crack like a hair on my iPhone 11.. Honestly it has not fallen yet although my previous iPhone 6s survived many drops with no cracks at all even after 4 years.. strange and surprising that the glass quality is very bad as compared to the old phones
708,Abhishek,Best phone with best price,2,With good packing i have the best phone with good price as well. With original packing as well
709,Nitish Sood,Not Starting Phone,5,I Purchased iPhone 11 And isn't working it's not starting please help me how to start

711,Javed khan,Best iPhone,5,I was an iPhone 7 user earlier. I switched to this 11 after my old phone broke. It is a superb experience while using it. Specially when you upgrade from old iPhone to this iPhone 11. The colour purple is awesome. I loved the look and camera quality is much better. Battery life is very well. Only thing is it takes around 2-3 hours to get fully charged. Otherwise best phone in market.
712,Thivakar,Touch,4,"Everything is cool, apart from the touch which is sometimes doesn’t work at one touch and you’ll have to try again for 3-4 times…. That work and that’s a problem i think i found here in this phone"

724,REETESH KUMAR,Its an iPhone- Its definitely awesome!,5,"A great product that I got. Value for money. Got it in the offer period and its been 3 months I am using it. Too good. Probably these days 64GB is not enough and one should opt for 128GB. But the product that I have got, its great! Performance wise, Camera and picture quality, processor, overall a great one."
725,Kathi Pavani,front camera quality is worst,4,"Updating my review after 6 months of usePros:1. Device performance is commendable2. Primary Cameras are up to the mark3. Battery backup is fair enough, lasts for whole day even after extensive usage (screen time up to 7 hours)Cons:Front camera quality is so cheap, takes good picture only in day or full light exposure outside, indoor pictures are too grainy and noisy, dis not expect this cheap quality camera from Apple, even MI budget phones have better front camera than iPhone 11"
726,Abhishek,Using since long live it,2,Nice product but only one draw back is less accessory adapter and earphone overall product is good using iPhone past 12years

Although i was skeptical about display before buying due to LCD and comparison to OLEDs on Pro series of iphones. But trust me, you cant go wrong with this beauty. I was using iphone X one year back, th3n switched to Samsung S9+ and again came back to ios. Right now I am having both S9+and iphone 11 and when I compare both displays side by side, iphone 11's display never disappoint me in any way and give tough competition through its liquid retuna display to suoer amoled of Samung!! A must buy for iPhone lovers. Sound is also too good."

732,Abhishek,Upgraded successfully..,2,I give 5 stars to this amazing product purchased on 17 oct 2020 i am repeated apple customer started from 5c which was my first apple phone then 6 and  now 11.i like everything in apple from looks to camera.the new thing which i am using very first time is faceid which is very very fast and obviously ios14 is quite impressive..
733,Kaushambi,One word. Apple !,3,Nothing much to complain about. I got it at the best price 42K for 128GB. I gifted it to my wife.
734,Mangudi Anand,Apple done,5,Use carefully screen damage cost use flip covers
735,Karthikeyan,Best decision ever,5,One of the best ❤️I recommend you darshita electronics as the product is brand new check the warranty and everything from the offical apple site and used for 4 days no heating up or anything as I’m a pubg player too just one thing the charger is 5w and it charges slow would recommend you to buy a 12w rest everything is great
736,Jaideep,Highly Recommend,5,Thanks Amazon for providing genuine apple Iphone i had check it online apple authorised in apple online site it’s genuinely items warranty starts when i was active this mobile everything product is very nice and Red colour is Amazing and iam first time purchase online apple iphone Thanks again Amazon for this and i will trust you blindly in future any time.

738,Abhishek,iPhone 11,2,Excellent product by Apple once again.Camera quality is fantastic and low-light pictures are brilliant.Battery Life is decent and last for full one day (as per usage).Face ID is really fast (can be annoying outside since you are wearing a mask these days)Screen is rich in color and vides and photos looks amazing.Overall an excellent device.
739,Anu dhiman,Value of money on iphone series.,5,I always want to have iphone and it coming under my budget.

741,Ramesh Elukurthy,Good phone could be better,4,I still didn't understand the concept of not providing adapter in the box. Keeping thousands of money for one phone and not getting a adapter is just not right.
742,Vivek S.,Night Mode and iOS make this phone,5,iOS is easily the most intuitive piece of software you will ever use. I have used tons of different phones and software and this has hands down taken the least amount of time taken to learn.What's more is that you can use Siri to control the phone and every single app without ever having to touch the phone. The camera has also been improved to take crisper shots. The best part is the automatic night mode which is different from the other phones where you will have to tweak the settings yourself.
743,NEGI S,The best you can get!,5,It’s just beautiful. The iOS is so fluid and smooth. No lags whatsoever. Camera takes awesome pics. The best part is the battery. It easily lasts 1 day and maybe more with fairly intensive use. I am moving from Android to IOS and I already know that I am never ever going back to Android again. The phone feels solid and sturdy in the hand.I don’t have any negatives to write about even though I really thought about writing some because a review is never fair without writing pros and cons. Go for it with eyes closed and you won’t go wrong. Go for a 128 Gigs. You will definitely need it.
744,Abhishek,Value for money Phone.,2,"The Camera quality is upto the mark. The display is decent too , battery life is good & 6hrs of screen on time is easily achievable. The stereo speakers are stunning with loud and crisp sound even the bass sounds fuller and deep. The build quality of phone is solid and elegant. This is the value for money phone to buy now."

It's been just 30 hours since I opened and I am perfectly happy with this. The white color gives the classic feeling.

Value for money!! & Premium feel!!!,5,"If you are an Android user who wants to move to iOS, then this is the best iPhone you can get without spending unnecessary huge amount on pro versions.I myself would have preferred OLED displays over LCD display on iPhone 11 but I just bought the iPhone 11. Trust me the display is very very good on this phone & with all the same chipset as the pro versions, there's really not much that you are losing.You won't regret this purchase if you want to start using iOS! Everything is very fluid & I like it a lot!! Don't think will be moving to Android in future."

I suggest you to buy iphone 11 without any problem."
792,Abhishek,Good product,2,I like this product very much the quality and packing  is good and the delivery service is also good
793,Pratik Jadhav ,Good phone,5,Great phone
794,Chaithanya Gudivada,Charging adapter warranty,5,Charging adapter is not working.It’s been just three months I bought the productHow can I get a new charger as it is having 6 months warranty for in box accessories.Please do the needful.
795,Professor,How does Amazon sell iPhones cheaply,5,"How is Amazon able to sell iPhone 11 at 48999?Simple it’s refurbished models by AppleCheck the model number at the back of the box, if it starts with F it’s refurbished by AppleSince it’s refurbished by Apple it will still have the 1 year warranty but now you understand how the prices are so cheap"

797,MD shahnawaz,Super phone iPhone. I’m loving it..,5,I am an android user till date . But super excited for this hard earned money buy. Loved the in hand feel of the iPhone 11. I am very happy.. will update about the phone after a month of usage. Brought this super hero from great Indian festival .at 12 am midnight. And seller shipped it in the morning. Thanks.
798,Abhishek,Amazing ❤️,2,"Its amazing! The experience is buttery smooth! The camera quality is also very good. Jus the charger that comes along, is a 5watt charger, so it takes a lot of time to get charged. You need to buy a fast charger."
799,SATKAR,Complete star piece🌟,5,"Its been a month i am using this phone i.e the iphone 11 which i ordered from amazon and got the delivery by 14th of july. Since then, i have never faced any issue regarding this piece. Except the charger issue it must have been a rapid charger instead of this 5 watt charger its still ok it takes 4-5 hours to charge completely."
800,Vidushi khulbe,Good service,4,Thanks  Amazon received the product with in two days. I phone 11 is a good phone but in case of battery is taking more time to charge and battery life is ok better than my previous  I phone 7
801,Amazon Customer,Great Buy iPhone,4,"Excellent product with great features which are key differentiators compared to others:- Best design and weight- Best camera on low light- Best display and graphics- Best Batery usagesExpensive became affordable, Thanks to iPhone 12 and Amazon offers."
802,Pratya,Amazing is the word,5,I am writing this review after use of 1month of iPhone11 and it’s really amazing to use. Camera  quality is really good and face detection is too quick. With 64GB version you have to take backup regularly to get the space management but with 128GB version it’s could be easier but this is not an issue.
803,Anudeep,except battery life every thing is great on this phone,5,nice
804,Abhishek,Average look and few disappointments,2,Button placements were wrong and best place for power button is top (like previous versions) only. Now they kept like Android phones and whenever I want to increase volumes it takes screen shot. The phone also looks average and most of the time I mistook my wife android phone as my phone. Not very happy with iPhone11
805,Rajasekaran R,Genuine and latest stock,5,Good product. Leave aside the fake paid negative reviews. Product is genuine and all accessories are included as mentioned. Not faced any heating issue as described by a few. Guess people complaining may have bought from dubious sellers ( who are there even on the Amazon USA site and also on Flipkart). Well known sellers you can never go wrong.
806,Neel kant Verma,Best,5,Best
807,Shubham Bala,Great product except than the heating issues,5,"The device initially had heating issues, during charging and while using for calls and internet. Later with the iOS update the heating problem was solved, but still we can expect the same issue to happen with the new OS updates."
808,Ashish Kotecha,Excellent face recognition feature,5,Two things I dislike about iPhone - 1. Inability to transfer important data/information from iPhone to computer and 2. Short battery lifeWhat I like most - Facetime feature for easy connectivity to my friends/relations around the world.
809,Sanjeetsingh Rajput,Poor Iphone,5,Bakwas mobile hai iphone. Itne paise me bahaut ache options aate h show off k alawa kuch lena ho to.

 iPhone always OP couse it has a different fan base ❣️. Our main issue is battery life but this particular product gives you 24 hrs at 96-100% charged. Nothing to say about iOS, it is really fast . Camera is just outstanding at any time…"
814,RAJ KUMAR DHAKA,Good device in budget.,4,"So far it’s good and if you have purchased during the sale, then it’s worth it whatever you have spent."
815,Bunty Narang,Awesome,5,The face recognition is flawless. Battery life is very good. Lasts almost one and half days. Camera pictures are great
816,Abhishek,Iphone is iphone,2,Aacha phone hai but charger saath milta to or bhi aacha hota koi ni phone ke mamle me best hai
817,Rukhsar Rizvi,The best mid-range premium device,5,I liked iPhone 11 64GB Black because of its camera quality and best ever offers on it. A mid range flagship smartphone!!
818,Akshay,Authenticity of the product,5,"I recieved my iphone 11 on monday and i don’t have any complaints or negative reviews about the delivery or the products or the reseller tooAs alot of stuff were going on during these sale about the authenticity of the product and the refurbishment, but i can say by own experience the product was in perfect condition"
819,Abu talib,Excellent,5,Like
820,Dhruv Gajjar,Offers are real. Do not ignore them because it sounds unreal and you could get a faulty product,5,"Before placing the order on the prime day sale, I was very confused about the incredible offers they put up. My neighbour shop warned me about the refurbished phone. But negating all the confusion and risk, I ordered. And I got a perfectly normal brand new iPhone.I am writing this review just to let everyone out there, OFFERS ARE REAL. Grab them!!"
821,Firoz Khan,Time to move to iOS,5,Me a ten year android user finally switched to iOS and this was a deal which couldn’t be refused. About iPhone everything is great. Just two cons comparatively less battery back up if you coming from 5000/6000mAH android phones and screen has a bit of yellow tint but it can be resolved from settings. So overall 8.5/10 for the phone.
822,Abhishek,Best in class!!! Beast!!!,2,The best in class. There is a feel good factor about this phone. Almost perfect for a regular guy. Battery life first class though need to follow some battery saving tips. Camera one of the best awesome clarity and i am in love with studio light pictures. Nice clean os with now having some new gestures.face recognition almost worked 95% for me.loved it. If anyone has any doubts or need any clarity comment here i will be happy to help.
823,Shaurya Khanna,Awesome camera!,3,"I was afraid after seeing a scam video on YouTube but amazon won my trust and delivered me an original and brand new i phone 11 so happy for this great camera quality,a day battery life in moderate use,i was super amoled display user so little disappointed for LCD i will update my review after 1 month use."
824,Deepak,Totally satisfied,5,Bought this iPhone 11 64gb variant. I got this phone in 50k in Great Indian Festival sale. I was worried that during this sale Amazon is sending clone iPhone but I got original product and my all worries were vanished. Fully satisfied with this iPhone and with iPhone.If you are planning to buy this phone then go ahead.
825,Shraddha Ranjan,Good,5,"Actually read many bad reviews about the seller and product and researched many sites and purchased the product with half-heart.But the product is good as purchased in apple Store.No issues, actually we need to update the OS once received . once updates there is no issue as mentioned in the bad reviews . you can absolutely go on this product"
826,Dinesh,Good experience,4,Such a good experience with iphone 11. I upgraded from iphone 6 and the experience is great. Picture quality is very nice. Battery life is pretty good for a normal internet user(not excessive). The size of the phone is little bit bigger. Sometimes it feels bulky. But overall a good experience with it. Worth the price.
827,Akhil Tumuluri,It's Good?,5,"I don't think there should be a review because people who want to buy this phone must have gone through all the bits of its features. Just one thing, that is my opinion, for a price of 50k, Apple could have given an OLED display instead of an LCD."
828,Abhishek,Amazingly Good,2,Everything was perfectly amazing from the delivery of the product in a secure package to the fast delivery and proper packaging.About the product it doesn’t seems right to comment on that as it’s an iPhone and you all might be aware of that. But I would like to assure you just one thing that the product is genuine.
829,Aamir khan,Go for it,4,Beautiful handset by apple. Manufactured 2 months before Feb2021. Got 5k instant discount from hdfc credit card and final cost was ~50k. you have to buy 20w adapter to charge your phone.I switched from iphone6 to 11 . missing fingerprint scanner and headphones port. Thanks
830,Tanu Taxi,Totally worth it,5,I am one plus user for past 3 years was kinda bored of android wanted to shift to iOS. This phone is totally worth it and has a very premium experience . Although s20 fe was available at the same range i purchased this phone.  If you are looking to buy it you should go for it without hesitation.
831,Anvitha,Beautiful Device! Loving iOS❤️,4,"Amazing device! Loved it! The only thing that bugs me is the Heating issue! I suppose it’s with all the iOS devices. Other than that the camera quality, the build quality, the display ( though it’s not LED but produces bright and vibrant colours) everything is gorgeous! My first iOS device and I’m in love with it!"
832,gaurav kumar,Killer performance,4,Best iPhone ever. Great battery life and amazing night photography
833,Indira,worthy phone with affordable price in iPhone range,4,if you are not a game lover and just spend your time with social media and productivity work then you can go for it.. the battery life run almost for a day after fully charged.
834,Abhishek,"No 5g,no fast charger, no case,",2,"Awesome body and look. Weight is little heavy. No 5g support,No finger print sensor, no fast charger,no case inside box, best new was e sim support we can use as secondary sim I.e dual sim support in others words if we say, battery life is ok, over all 4 out of 5. Best experience I would have given 5 out of 5, if it supports 5g."
835,Ambika kumar,Good phone,5,Nice camera but battery backup is not good.
836,Amazon Customer,Orginal product sealed,4,Phone is premium feels good in hand sound quality is good camera are okay you can record 4 k price is high go for one plus 8 t I use one plus 7t and there is a a little difference between both iphone 11 and OnePlus 7t 258 gb where as my iphone is 128 gb price difference 13 thousand

838,Ajay arya,A great iPhone for the money,5,Superb PerformanceA13 Bionic is a 7nm-based processor that Apple claims delivers the fastest CPU and GPU performance in a smartphone. There is no denying that the iPhone 11 feels extremely fast and buttery smooth in pretty much everything from launching and running games to browsing social media apps.
839,vikrant singh,It’s very good,5,It’s good & I got it for best price in Amazon sale
840,Abhishek,Amazon is trust worthy bought my second phone from amazon and you don’t need to worry,2,The product is worth itDelivery was a little delayed to srinagar but overall product is amazing by apple and you can trust upon amazon tooThere is enough security now by amazon so that your product doesnt get cheated

846,Abhishek,iPhone 11,2,One of the best iPhones. It has all the good features in a decent price. The good thing about Apple is that it gives you the same performance in iphone11 as the flagship iphone11 pro/promax. It just cuts down on certain features like display or an additional camera.Overall a good phone and a good experience till date.
847,SHUBHAM MALIK,Phone with superb camera and moderate battery,4,Bought it at 53k during great indian festival. I am writing it after 12 days of use. Camera is one of the best.Battery is not that good neither is bad. Display is fantastic.All in allCamera-4.5/5Battery-3.5/5Display-4.5/5Overall-4/5

But have to check camera quality after using for few days."

866,Abdul,Great value out of this iPhone!,5,"Been using an iPhone 7 since 3 years, so I upgraded to 11 when it came. This pricing of iPhone 11 and the 6000 discount by HDFC makes it a really good buy. Other discounts included, I got it at ~57K which is a great price considering a flagship Android still costs around 40K to 50K. And camera of this iPhone is a work of art. It is smooth, captures great colours, works with vivid detail. Overall, this was a good experience!"

884,AVIK MAJI,Just a Bling.,5,"So please read complete review. This will surely give u a perspective.The quality of I phones are better. And a few aspects of a smartphone also better on an iPhone. But, how many of us know or even realise the difference?Does the cost justifies the degree with which it's better than an Android?The battery is nowhere near an Android.The notch is ugly.If anything it's just a piece of jewelry. And don't get me wrong but it does the job well as an accessory.It's good for flaunting for about a month before you realise that you could have bought a kick-ass Android on the same price.Now....Did I buy it? Yes.Did I return it? No.Am I using it? No.This is what happens when you buy it for someone who does not know why he wants it. All he wants is an iPhone. So that he can post pictures of himself in front of a mirror in which clarity of the face don't matter but the logo of apple should be seen clear.Who's iPhone for then?1. Highly techies individual who knows how to use an iPhone to it's full capacity.2. People who really admire quality and most importantly can tell the difference.3. People who does not get bored of a phone and intend to use it for years.4. Most importantly, and this applies to above three also. People who can really afford it.If someone is buying older iPhone models in present that actually means he doesn't need it."

Thanks alot Amazon for delivering quality and original products."

Was mentioned for product return but they sad visit to service center and they said have product indicated with any signal or not for heat up problem.They updated the phone said it will not going to happen again but it’s happening again.Was not happy with battery backups also."
935,Rituraj Sharma,"Beautiful Phone, careless delivery",5,"Very expensive phone compared to the competitors. But iOS and apple’s smoothness and responsiveness can’t be equalled. Happy with the offers provided by Amazon, makes iPhone a possible buy.But one bad experience was the delivery. The package looks crushed and box was torn, outer packing looked untampered. Luckily the phone was not damaged.But when purchasing such an expensive product would expect better handling of the package.There were few negative reviews regarding this, but I thought Amazon would be more careful, But pretty shocked on the package condition.Attached photo shots of the box I got the phone in, real miracle phone survived the transit."

938,Amazon Customer,Review Strictly for android users,5,If you are first time using iphone just to notify this does not have a fingerprint option.

Great collaboration of software and hardware. Ultra high speed. Excellent camera. Extra ordinary security of personal data due to strict apple policy.Price has been reduced drastically after launch of iPhone 12. What else you need in the phone?
994,Gaurav Arora,The real flagship. Its a monster,4,“Battery life” is awesome. 1 and half day after rough use.“Camera quality” is unbelievable. Best camera phone in this range.A13 bionic cheap is a monster.After all this is apple. I think it will give a hard competition with a 1 lacs rupee phone.Display quality is negotiable.

Mine is functioning well with minute scratches after 10+ months of usage5. Speaker phone volume is low6. Ringtone volume is low. Missed so many calls if someone is on the move7. No support on third party apps like WhatsApp, Facebook or Adobe"

1004,MUSHTAQUE Sir,Good purchase but faulty phone delivered.,5,Phone as such was fantastic. Excellent battery life on mediocre usage takes two days to come down to 10%. Very good camera quality.But the phone delivered to me was faulty. The mic on the bottom was not working properly. The opponent caller can’t hear the voice clearly. But Apple support guided on the problem and visited the service centre to get it rectified perfectly without any additional cost. Now everything is fine.

I reached out to Apple Care for support and they said my phone contains ""unauthorized"" parts due to which they cannot repair my phone and that my warranty is void. It doesn't make any sense to me as why would anyone in the right mind put an unauthorized part in an under warranty iphone. Never buying any phone from Amazon ever again"

1126,naresh,Does not seem to have simple yet useful things...,4,"Have been a Sony fan for more than a decade. Since Sony does not sell its phones in India, had to pick this one. This phone lacks the notification LED on the front. You need to turn the phone on to look for anything you have missed when you were away from the phone.  No fingerprint sensor.  No smart dial or i am yet to explore the option. The earpods which came with the phone is all plastic and not useful for long hours of music. May be they are made that way."

1253,Jithin J,Works good. Back side bottom heats up little,5,iPhone 11 64GB. working good . Back side bottom heats up little while using multiple apps. Storage is a BIG concern. Go for 128 Gb. 64 Gb gets filled soon. One trip with 40 photos and 5 videos consumes 5 GB.
1254,Abhishek,Super,2,Like this iphone 11 best
1255,Amit Nandi,Review after 7 months,5,My review after 7 months of use ... battery health at 96%... that is mostly because I use a fast charger now and then else the health would have been at ~98%... yes the phone heats up at load and when plugged even interaction with the phone is hard as the temp go crazy ... never was concerned about the storage as I use cloud ... it’s fine ... will update his post later a year ... I invested in the phone for the long 6+ years S/W support ...

1367,AJ,Great phone,5,Excellent phone
1368,Abhishek,Perfect condition. Great battery life,2,Bought this phone despite multiple clone tags in the reviews. But the phone is in perfect condition and the battery life is excellent. Would suggest you to buy the 12w or 18w power adaptor though. The 5w adaptor which comes with this isn’t sufficient.

1370,Pradeep Chake,iPhone is an iphone,4,Good
1371,shivangi,Ok but not Great.,5,I like the phone. I love the camera. And iOS as a software is perfect. But the only issue I had with this phone was the weight and the screen. I would've preferred an oled display but seeing that this is a replacement for XR it wouldn't have been reasonable (That's apple for you).TL;DrGo for iphone XS if you want a good screen and that premium feeling and the perfect weight. Go for the 11 if you want the latest software and the camera upgrade.

1661,Amazon Customer,Big fraud by Amazon by saying 7 days replacement,3,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I received iPhone 11 yesterday and just after doing the initial setup as soon as I used the phone the touch screen stopped working and I was unable to swipe up and use the phone at all. I raised a exchange request immediately. But Amazon completely denied to exchange the phone even after it has 7 day replacement and suggested me to visit apple Care center for resolution. The product is not even repaired by Apple store and had been sent to Bangalore office.Amazon is selling all defective products in the sale at lower price so that they can fool customer with the cheaper price.Amazon has started fooling customer with the hidden policies."

Is this justified?Also I have opted for 6 months no cost emi but when I see my credit card statement entire amount is due. Amazon now claiming that I have not opted for any emi option and asking me whether I took any screenshot while making payment. Such an unprofessional behaviourNow come to the phone-Everything is awesome except whenever you make call or incoming calls the network for that number dies and quality of call is terrible . I am using it as dual sim and not sure if it bcoz of this.Battery also taking too much time to get chargedMobile is heating after half an hour of use

But this one came with a considerable discount and a cut on the side.The support team are too much exhausting .With this state of product we approached Amazon who redirected us to apple support link.Now we needed to call apple support who mentioned that -since we bought from Amazon we need to contact Amazon for the exchange.Now we are sandwiched between the two giants describing their t&c and the process part.Initially we thought it was part of the process but over the time it’s frustrating.The problem with the above was that there was no clear path to the get the product replaced.The actual requirement was that apple has to provide the service denial email and some ticket for local authorised apple vendor. Even then there was a not this one we need the other one.Conclusion - apart from the discount, apple products are best bought from a apple website or authorised apple vendor. Due to t&c of apple , Amazon can’t help you much in this matter"

1955,T.p,Feeling cheated,5,"I purchased the iPhone 11 for my daughter. She was very keen to have her own iPhone. On 20 oct 2020, after receiving the package I opened it and switched on the iPhone. It was devastating for us, my daughter in particular to see a red spot in the screen. Immediately I took up with Amazon help. But they disowned on the pretext that Apple, the manufacturer can only help on this. I contacted Apple help but they tried to shift the responsibility to seller. We were put in a state of helplessness. Finally I decided to visit the Apple service centre. On 21 Oct 2020 I visited the service centre, they acknowledged the problem in the iPhone Screen and took it with a promise either to fix the screen or change the mobile. I contended, I have bought a brand new iPhone to gift to my daughter and I don’t want a “repaired tag” in this. I want the iPhone to be replaced. They said decision of Apple would be binding on me, I can’t demand anything. I am still waiting to hear from them. I don’t know what Apple is going to do.In the meantime Amazon and the seller are happy to have sold a faulty product to me and the poor me after running from pillar to post is waiting for the mercy of Apple."

 I received the phone on 19 sep 2021 and I purchased my adapter separately and received on 21 sep. There was no charge in phone so when I put on charge it stuck in apple logo and keep rebooting. Called to Amazon and they don’t take ownership since it’s apple responsibility which is eventually 300 km far . Just I could not understand if we receive damage product or wrong manufactured then it’s customer who has to struggle. Very bad experience. Please stay away from buying phone specially iPhone from Amazon"

Never buy any costly items on the ecomm sites.Detail Explanation of problems faced:I bought the iPhone 11 128GB Black during Amazon big billion days happened between 16 Oct 2020 to 22 Oct 2020. Orderd on 16 Oct 2020 and it got delived on 18 Oct 2020. As like other recent news like fake products. Thank god that i didnt got any fake product/cloned product. When i got the phone and connected to wifi, it asked for the ios14 update. During the update process itself phone hanged and it didnt respond. Left it overnight so that it could complete so by morning mobile was dead. I had switched on the mobile by keeping in charging. 1 day it worked fine and very next day.. there is no network, and a pop-up message stating ""you can't make calls/send messages or use mobile data untill phone get updated"". In Phone update there is no suggestions and already showing ur phone is updated. By restarting the phone the network came back. So left it. Again next day morning situation repeats. Now my mbl is with Apple service provider as they find fault in the device and sent to Apple. Not even 3 days i had my new phone which i bought for 54000/- left at the service centre."

2382,Pranshu Saxena,Damaged Phone Supplied by Amazon,5,"Beware of Amazon and the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd. Never purchase high end phones from online platform. The phone delivered to me yesterday was in damaged condition with vertical line on the screen.After contacting Amazon I was asked to take a note from authorised Apple service centre. Even after doing the same I was asked by one of the Amazon representative again to get one more letter from service centre. To my surprise, the service centre denied stating they never issue letters, other than the service record sheet. Still waiting for Amazon to process the exchange of iPhone 11.Horrible experience with #Amazon. 😭Rating of 1 star is for Amazon and the seller and not for the phone. Further I don't have idea for battery, face recognition and camera as I was not able to use iphone 11 and till now I have only bitter experience."
2383,vishal Divekar,Just an average phone with hefty price!,5,I am not impressed by the camera as it should be considering phones like Oneplus and google pixel 4. The night mode is good but other than this the camera does not have much to offer.Battery is okay.Processor is good. The size of iPhone 11 is 6.1inch which is more than pro variant.Overall average phone as compared to Oneplus and Google Pixel 4.

Phone is lil heavy and needs to be handled with care along with a case.Apple is still selling years old 5w charger which is a shame ! One needs to buy a 12W charger or it takes  3 hours to charge from zero.No one has a fix for Lense flare. Will check with service center and post later"

I contacted Apple customer care and they confirmed that the device was used before to create other apple ids. They said this error comes only if the phone is refurbished or used as a demo phone.Also i would like to highlight, amazon and apple have a tie up and if you need to replace a iphone purchased from amazon,you have to go to their store physically and get a job sheet from apple. In my case, when i approached apple for the job sheet they deleted the phone’s history from their end and said that there wasnt any issue with the phone. the previous error(screenshot) vanished and i could successfully create a new id with that phone.Overall disappointed not just with Amazon but also Apple..#sabkimilijhulibhagat #cheated #untrustworthy"

Camera has too much noise in the picture quality . Blurred image is common in all the pictures . Facial recognition is worst . Even my sister is able to open .

2886,Ravi,"Innovation of Apple died with Steve jobs, now it's just a profit greedy organisation",4,Pro- Camera & PerformanceCon- Hideous Notch (why d hell nobody talks about it??)Batteryटिप्पणी-भारत में अब Apple अपने किसी अतिविशिष्ट hardware या software के नहीं अपितु दिखावे की वस्तुमात्र (वैभव-प्रतीक) होने के कारण विक्रित होती है।जिसमें दूसरों को हीन तथा स्वयं को मिथ्याश्रेष्ठ या धनवान दिखाने की फूहड़ व भौंडी मानसिकता का कंपनी अपने लाभहेतु दोहन करने का प्रयास करती है।इसके अतिरिक्त मुझे इस फ़ोन में ऐसा कुछ भी अतिविशेष दिखाई नहीं दिया जो इससे आधे या उससे भी कमदाम के फ़ोन में उपलब्ध न हो।

Strange And stupid Reason...!!

I am not able to get it repaired and the service center has recommended me to buy a replacement for 43,500 rupees. This is simply unacceptable as even the initial EMI payment for the phone has not been completed yet. Why should I buy a replacement mobile when the mobile I purchased has stopped working through no fault of mine? The famed ""reliability"" of Apple products was just a myth. Very disappointed with both Amazon and Apple."

3131,Abhishek,Dont Buy iphone from amazon,2,I purchased iPhone last year in oct during great Indian festival. This seller sells defective products. My phone is having  multiple issues. I noticed this after the return period. I have issues with charging slot. Whenever I connect the charging cable it shows accessory is not supported. And when i connect earpods the it automatically goes to loudspeaker. Sometimes the touch screen never responds. And after few months battery performance is pathetic. So please buy apple products from an apple store or authorised reseller and not from amazon. When I contacted apple support they asked me to visit near by authorised service centre. And for getting  this issue fixed it might take 1 month or more. I have to Leave my phone with them. This is totally a waste of money.

3264,Ravi,Amazon sells fake phone,4,This isn’t a real iPhone.Amazon is seeking duplicate iPhone I guess. My friends had bought iPhone along with me from apple’s website and it’s working absolutely fine with best quality of camera and battery life being 98%. Whereas the iPhone I bought from Amazon has only 82% battery life today. Really a pathetic experience with Amazon. I will never ever buy electronic items from Amazon after this. Wanted to write this review long time ago. Please don’t buy any electric items from Amazon. I think it’s mostly fake products .

3274,Ravi,Loved it,4,Awesome product
3275,Abhishek,"Not good, feels similar to android phones in 20-25 K category",2,"if you are an android user, you will have many letdowns. first and formost home button, back button, close all options. camera does not seem out of the world compared to other android phones 20K range. you will have to loose whatsapp chat completely, lot many features for users which are simple in android are either not there or you have to learn to use it in a different way.in summary if you are a decade old android user, you will not be comfortable"
3276,Ravi,The best,4,The best

3306,Ravi,My fav I phone,4,I phone 11 is awesome product.Amazon shopping is most exciting.
3307,Abhishek,Money,2,Good
3308,Ravi,Not a great phone,4,"The touch is intermittent...sometimes great... sometimes doesn’t respond. Heavy. Network receiver not working properly. What else to say... feeling cheated....After one month.....Now it’s been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it’s the worst product from Apple. I don’t know what’s the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it’s not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn’t work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don’t find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly."
